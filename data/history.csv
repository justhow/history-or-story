Gillis Hogan, a PhD researcher studying the history of magic, and the creator of the new podcast ""Arcane: The History of Magic"" available everywhere - Ask Me Anything!","Initially from Canada, I am currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Exeter in England. My current research examines the surviving late medieval and early modern manuscripts that contain rituals intended to summon fairies (although people at the time conceptualized fairies  very differently than we tend to today).  


My interest in magic extends well beyond this particular research focus, however, and I have spent the last decade studying magic in various historical contexts, so feel free to ask me anything!  
My new podcast, Arcane, is meant for anyone who is interested in magic and its history. You can find it wherever you listen to podcasts, or follow this link: [https://arcanehistory.podbean.com](https://arcanehistory.podbean.com)

37,"A place to find ""pirate"" songs/shanties (with or without instruments)?","I have no idea if this is the right sub so I'm sorry if this is going to the wrong place or if I'm clogging the feed, but I feel my matter is as much about history as it is about music so that's why I thought this'd be the place. I hope that's not a problem. I also hope there are people knowledgeable of the 17th and 18th century and the music of those times (because I sure as hell am not).

&amp;#x200B;

So I really like the notes that the modern pirate songs hit (like the generic Pirates of the Caribbean theme and also this shanty called Eliza Lee but I don't believe it's that modern) and I've been trying to find like an orchestra or a choir that sings these types of songs but that the songs would also be authentic and actual songs and shanties from the 17th and 18th century. Not much luck so far, that's why I'm here. I've found some random gems like the before mentioned Eliza Lee shanty, but if someone knows a place to find some or someone has like a playlist of ""authentic pirate music"" I'd be more than happy to give it a listen.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really hard to explain what I'm looking for without sounding like an annoying fanboy of the stereotypical, somewhat historically inaccurate and glorified pirates of the popular culture. I also understand if the music is just made up in the modern days and there are no historically accurate pirate songs out there that are similar to the modern pirate music (in notation and feel). I tend to ask for too much when seeking help on the internet so I'll accept any suggestions, but I'm tired of searching ""pirate shanty"" and ""pirate band/orchestra"" on the internet and thought if someone in here happens to share the same passion for that kind of music and the history behind it (which I know very little about but it's still really interesting), I'd be happy to check the stuff out.

And there were large stakes on which they could see the impaled bodies of men, women, and children, about twenty thousand of them, as they said; quite a spectacle for the Turks and the sultan himself! The sultan himself, in wonder, kept saying that he could not conquer the country of a man who could do such terrible and unnatural things, and put his power and his subjects to such use.. And the other Turks, seeing so many people impaled, were scared out of their wits.""

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the quote is from Chal. himself but I'm having trouble finding the original source.

[This article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler#CITEREFTreptow2000) cites this quote from a newer book (from 2000), but I am interested in reading Chal's original work. The problem is that he wrote [10 Histories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laonikos_Chalkokondyles#The_Histories_of_Chalkokondyles) on the Byzantine empire and the surrounding territories, and I'm not sure which of these volumes(?) contains information on Vlad III. 

&amp;#x200B;

His account begins immediately after Princip fires his two shots:,"I first heard this quote from Dan Carlin and it always felt like such a powerful moment of history. Just in case you don‚Äôt know the story, they attempted to assassinate him with grenades in a parade I believe. After that failed and the archduke left he went into the city. There in the city in some smaller ally his car stalls. As the car coming back on, one of the people from the group trying to assassinate him happens to be walking past and sees him. This is from the viewpoint of the Archdukes bodyguard.

&gt;""As the car quickly reversed, a thin stream of blood spurted from His Highness's mouth onto my right check. As I was pulling out my handkerchief to wipe the blood away from his mouth, the Duchess cried out to him, 'In Heaven's name, what has happened to you?' At that she slid off the seat and lay on the floor of the car, with her face between his knees.

&gt;I had no idea that she too was hit and thought she had simply fainted with fright. Then I heard His Imperial Highness say, 'Sopherl, Sopherl, don't die. Stay alive for the children!'

&gt;At that, I seized the Archduke by the collar of his uniform, to stop his head dropping forward and asked him if he was in great pain. He answered me quite distinctly, 'It's nothing!' His face began to twist somewhat but he went on repeating, six or seven times, ever more faintly as he gradually lost consciousness, 'It's nothing!' Then, after a short pause, there was a violent choking sound caused by the bleeding. It was stopped as we reached the Konak.""

I'm admittedly way more knowledgeable on 19th/20th century western history, so building a list was pretty easy - there was a clearly defined algorithm of 1) Known authors 2) cost on Amazon (Kindle), and 3) a ratio between my desire to learn more about a particular president and the number of pages in the book.

For Greco Roman history, I know basically nothing but have always been fascinated by it so want to learn more. Obviously I won't go leader by leader, but are there particular books or authors that I can't miss? Timeframes I definitely need to read to understand what comes next? I'd be cool with anywhere between 10 and 30 books probably, and would definitely want to do them in chronological order again.

America asks that you take immediate heed of what we say on this leaflet.
We are in possession of the¬†most destructive explosive¬†ever devised by man. A single one of our newly developed atomic bombs is actually the equivalent in explosive power to what 2000 of our giant B-29s can carry on a single mission. This awful fact is one for you to ponder and we solemnly assure you it is¬†grimly accurate.
We have just begun to use this weapon against your homeland. If you still have any doubt, make inquiry as to what happened to Hiroshima when just one atomic bomb fell on that city.
Before using this bomb to destroy every resource of the military by which they are prolonging this useless war, we ask that you now petition the Emperor to end the war. Our president has outlined for you the thirteen consequences of an honorable surrender. We urge that you accept these consequences and begin the work of building a new, better and peace-loving Japan.
You should take steps now to cease military resistance. Otherwise, we shall resolutely employ this bomb and all our other superior weapons to promptly and forcefully end the war.
EVACUATE YOUR CITIES.

Naoroji and Bhownaggree became MPs during the Victorian era for both the Liberal party and the Conservative Party.

1,What are you‚Äôre thoughts on restoration?,"I‚Äôm not sure why, but I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot recenty. ‚ÄúRestoration‚Äù of old buildings, paintings, and whatever artifacts.

 Personally, I hate when you‚Äôre reading through an article about a castle or status which looks amazingly clean,  and you get to to the end to see ‚ÄúThe (X) has been restored in 1509, 1735, and 1996.‚Äù

If I go somewhere old,  I‚Äôd actually like the things to be old. I want to touch the same stone a builder did thousand years ago.. what an incredible bridge through time. I would so much prefer half knocked down walls, crumbling towers and overgrowth if it mean that place has not been rebuilt or restored in the modern age. 

I understand some people would like to see it  how it originally looked ( which will depend on the quality of the restoration.

Take Dover Castle in England for example. Large, beautiful castle, immediates evokes your idea of the Middle Ages. But the shit was extensively rebuilt in the 19th century! Also with paintings, they sometimes have to repaint over damaged or faded areas. Statues will have missing pieces created and attached.

I don‚Äôt even know why I care so much or why i feel it ruins it so much for me so I‚Äôd figure I‚Äôd the ask the community.  What do you guys think about restoration, do your prefer to see things as they were originally or do you like seeing things being left alone. 

Also asking if anyone knows of any sites like that.

We all watched those movies where there are only few weapons shown and we can see that the combat is represented on a bad way. For example the most famous and most frequent weapon we see is a sword, but how effective was it against a fully armored opponent? I know it depends a lot off opponents armor/weapon, but what is the best all around weapon in your opinion?

11,/r/history moderator applications. Want to help out this community? Look inside!,"Hi! 

As a more serious large subreddit it takes a lot of work to maintain /r/history. This also means that we are always looking to add a few more mods to the /r/history team. 
So we always have a link in our sidebar [to the moderator application page](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/mod_application) so people that are interested in becoming a mod can apply there.
However we also like to every once in a while draw a bit more attention to this process, which is why we made this post. This post gives the same information as on the linked wiki page, but it also allows you to ask questions about being a mod. 

## What do we expect from \/r/history moderators?

Here is a quick overview of the general things we are looking for: 

- **Experienced with reddit and \/r/history:** We are looking for experienced redditors who have been active on reddit with an account that is at least 1 year old. In addition to that we are looking for people who have contributed productively to this community. 
- **A firm interest in history:** We want people that are interested in the subject, so obviously you need to have a firm interest in history. 
- **Communicative towards users and fellow moderators:** You will communicate with other users on a regular basis, for this you need to be communicative, mature and civil. Lots of mod decisions are discussed in our backroom subreddit, modmail and irc, so you will need to be able to work well together with the other team members. 
- **Free time:** You don't need to have a ton of time on your hands, but when you get accepted you should have enough time to actually carry out moderating duties. 
- **Thick skin:** history is a subject people often try to use to push their agenda. When they are not allowed to do so they can get rather nasty. 
- **Willingness to install and use third party tools:** This includes browser extensions aimed at mods as found on /r/toolbox which are essential for moderating as well as using applications for chatting with the team on IRC. 

Some of the responsibilities include: 

- Review unmoderated links and modqueue reports and remove off topic and rule breaking content.
- Answer subscriber questions in modmail.
- Enforce sidebar rules.

If you have no idea how moderating works on reddit and want to check out more about that first you can have a look at [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/historymod101).

## What do I get in return? 

There is no monetary reward as it is all volunteer work. However you do get a better subreddit in return and a very friendly team work with. 
All of the mods are here because they love history and as such they want this subreddit to succeed in focusing on history and the discussion surrounding it. It is one of the reasons we always try to attract new moderators from within the /r/history community. 

## Great, how do I apply? 

You can do so [through this link](https://goo.gl/forms/jY5dBCGgwKgaTxID2), we will ask a few questions we will use in the application process. Take the time to answer them. As rule of thumb if all your answers are one line long it is very unlikely that you'll be considered. 

## How long will the applications be open for? 

We are always looking for new moderators so there is no end date as it is an ongoing process.

## Good luck!

The /r/history moderating team.

It also made no sense to me because once you hit puberty you were considered an adult so it wouldn't be weird at the time for an adult of 9 years old to marry an adult of 50 years old since they were both adults in the eyes of their society.

66,Was it Hitler or his Generals that bungled the Eastern Front?,"I know that postwar in a lot of memoirs of German generals, they blame Hitler and his incompetence for loosing WWII. Many of them said that if they had just redirected more soldiers to from the southern thrust in the caucuses Moscow than they city would have been taken and the Soviets would have collapsed. I find this incredibly suspect as the biggest issue for the Germans is that they did not have enough oil, and a southern thrust to take Stalingrad and Baku would have been necessary to beat the Soviets as it would take out their biggest oil supply and solve some of Germany's shortages. Furthermore, history has shown in the Napoleonic wars, just taking Moscow is not enough to beat the Russians. So would the Germans have done better if they had mainly focused on taking Baku and not mismanaged Stalingrad along with less of a focus on the drive to Moscow?",history,1532225081,ArtDecoFlamingo,21,11,True,2018-07-21

86,"God, Guns, and an African Uprising: an anecdote about missionaries in 1890s Rhodesia","Today, I want to share with you all a little anecdote from the 1896-97 Shona and Ndebele uprisings in Southern Rhodesia, regarding the typical image presented of European Christian missionaries in Africa.

**Background**

For those with little knowledge of the area or its history, here's some background information.

Southern Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe) was a British colonial possession in southern central Africa. It was composed of two main regions: Matabeleland in the south-west, and Mashonaland in the north-east, and two primary African ethnic groups, the Ndebele and the Shona. The Shona were the traditional inhabitants of the region, descended from the Kalanga groups of Great Zimbabwe fame. The Ndebele were relatively recent arrivals in the region, a group of Khumalo who had fled the Mfecane in the 1830s. Their arrival on the Zimbabwean plateau had seen them conquer and annex the existing Rozvi empire and create a strongly interconnected chiefdom, revolving around a central authority at Bulawayo. 

Fast forward fifty years. In 1888, Cecil Rhodes' company, the British South African Company (BSAC), was granted exclusive mineral rights to Mashonaland (in north-east Zimbabwe, as well as a royal charter for his company in 1889. In June 1890 the infamous 'Pioneer Column' pushed north from the Cape Colony almost to the Zambezi, and established the state of South Rhodesia. Several settlements were set up throughout Mashonaland, with the largest at Fort Salisbury in the North. 

In March 1896 the Ndebele rose up against the white settlers in Matabeleland. Within a week, over 140 white settlers had been killed and no settlers remained in the outlying districts of Matabeleland, having retreated into a laager at Bulawayo. By June, the Shona also arose in rebellion, attacking settlers in Mashonaland.  Violence was widespread and incredibly brutal: the arrival of British and Cape Colony forces saw warfare descend into guerrilla tactics. The African troops refused to engage en masse, instead attacking columns and supply trains, and raiding settlements at night in force. The British resorted to patrols and targeted strongholds, including on civilians. 

**Missionaries**

As part of the colonisation of Zimbabwe, a number of British missionaries arrived in the region representing a variety of denominations and missionary societies.  These missionaries provide a great source of information for the period, not only being present during the uprisings but also having a more intimate knowledge with the African peoples than the white soldiers or settlers.

However, there is a common misconception in the public mind that the Christian missionaries of the 19th century were peaceful types, who took with them on their endeavours nothing but the bible and a good Christian intent.

This anecdote proves otherwise.

The source is an account by the Welselyen Methodist Missionary, Rev. Isaac Shimmin, entitled 'From Salisbury to Bulawayo with the Scouts', in F.W. MacDonald, ed., *Work and Workers in the Mission Field*, Vol.VI (London, 1897)

&gt;'When near Charter we met some of Judson's patrol returning to Salisbury. With them was my colleague, Mr. White, who was in the ambulance corps and had done good service in many departments. It was a strange meeting for Wesleyan ministers, and we were both in peculiar garb. As I looked at him sitting on his horse with gun in hand and bandolier on shoulder, I thought of the paralysing effect his sudden appearance would cause amongst the grace and reverend fathers of the Methodist Conference. But the gift of adaptability is one not to be despised, especially in a new country. We were trying to be all things to all men in order to do the Masters work.'",history,1524401740,profrhodes,0,0,True,2018-04-22

I was reading this piece for research in a historical investigation related to the Makhno movement and I came across it in paragraph 11, this is the specific passage: 

*In this respect as in all others, the Makhnovites are no different from the Grigoriyevites; Grigoriyev also rebelled against the central authority in the name of local non-party soviets, that is, against the organised will of the whole working class, in the name of individual kulak groups and bands. It was not accidental that Grigoriyev, when he raised the banner of savage, pogrom-making mutiny and set out to exterminate the Communist, called on ‚Äòbaiko‚Äô Makhno to conclude a pogromists‚Äô alliance with him.*

So when I stumbled across this graphic novel by Big Red Hair I was a little dubious. I wondered if the company had done enough research, how accurate their depictions of Mesoamerican peoples would be, and if they would fall into any of the misconceptions or stereotypes that constantly surround the history of Mesoamerica and the early colonial period. However, after seeing their [bibliography](http://www.bigredhair.com/books/aztec-empire/bibliography/) my fears have been put to rest. And with the release of the first episode of the comic, I have to say I am quite impressed. The only other Mesoamerican comic book/graphic novel I am familiar with is Zotz. So it is refreshing to see another group of people attempt to tackle a region that so many people know so little about. I hope you check out Aztec Empire yourself and share your thoughts below.

It is also my understanding that Faulkner rerecorded the speech in studio, which can be found [here](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/williamfaulknernobelprizeaddress.htm), and also personally revised the written version for publication in the *Faulkner Reader* (as is stated at the bottom of the first link's webpage).

Did the public (or those at the Nobel Banquet, for that matter) not care about his less-than-stellar performance of the speech? Or was the more distributed and well known version the rerecorded or written one?

Oliver Cromwell had a mostly political impact on Britain and his only militaristic accomplishments were in Ireland and Scotland. General Wolfe‚Äôs only major feat was capturing Quebec from France; then he slipped up USA to George Washington and Spain and France. Admiral Nelson only had defensive feats likewise the Duke of Wellington. Winston Churchill was only successful in saving Britain and taking Germany with the help of many many others. The Duke of Marlborough (the most viable option after Oliver Cromwell in my opinion) albeit very impactful, never had the internal impact inside Britain that Napoleon Bonaparte managed in France. Henry Tudor hadn‚Äôt had any major impact outside of Britain. Queen Victoria wasn‚Äôt responsible for Britain‚Äôs Empire at the time in any way , shape or form. Queen Elizabeth I‚Äôs only major noteworthy feat was turning away the Spanish Armada. William the Conqueror (or Bastard) was NOT British and therefore I get peeved whenever he is mentioned as a British Conqueror. So, who do you think was the British equal of Napoleon or closest equal anyway?

I was thinking, almost every colonial power had their ‚ÄòNapoleon‚Äô; here are a couple I thought of:

He came back with quite a bit of artifacts from the war, and among them was a second edition of Mein Kampf. From what I understand, it was given to him by the local bergemiester as some form of gift (I know...odd). Inscribed on the first page is a signature ‚ÄúR. Wallenberg, Berlin 1928.‚Äù

It‚Äôs the only thing that stands out as to why this copy would have been given a gift, as maybe he thought the copy was from the famous diplomat, yet I have my doubts. Wallenberg had to have been a fairly common name. Also, it‚Äôs dated ‚ÄúBerlin 1928‚Äù. Wallenberg would only have been 16 at the time and I can‚Äôt find any evidence that he would have been in Berlin during this period of his life. 

Any help in constructing a timeline here would be helpful. Also if their was another R. Wallenberg that also played a role in the war that I‚Äôm missing let me know. ",history,1522584962,TheFuderalistPapers,6,19,True,2018-04-01

I'm aware of the artillery barrages and the grenades and the waves of troops running into machine gun fire, but when they're actually successful? I take it if a group managed to make it across No-Mans Land and into the opposing trench that there'd be a bit of stabbing and slicing going on, but I've never seen this demonstrated or explained.

1 trench line can hardly be held by both opposing sides, right? Either the attacker is repelled or the defenders are left shooting both infront of them and to their sides as the enemy zig-zag through the trenches. Would they be ordered to fall back to the next trench?

95,Franciscan Province of Silver Bosnia- How wise man was able to secure freedom of religion,"Hello fellow history lovers.

I live in Bosnia and Herzegovina and I would like to expose you to history of my country. Bosnian history is complicated and really bloody but it is interesting.

Now, to the point of this post

In 1463. Ottoman army under Mehmed the Conqueror overrun Jajce,capital city of Kingdom of Bosnia thus ending Bosnian Kingdom.
Local orthodox,catholic and Bogumil population in fear of their life escaped to Croatia and Hungary. To prevent this mass exodus
Franciscan friar Anƒëeo Zvijezdoviƒá(letter ƒë is like G in George; letter ƒá is like softer version of Ch in Khrushchev) was able to set meting with Mehmed in place called Milodra≈æ. Friar arguments were simple.If Mehmed allows freedom of religion merchants,miners and smiths would stay and their work would benefit Turkish economy. Mehmed granted freedom. In return Franciscans of Silver Bosnia recognized Mehmed as their sovereign. Mehmed the issued Ahdname(bill of oath) that guaranties religion freedom.
This document is also known as Ahdname of Milodra≈æ.
Ahdname of Milodra≈æ enabled the survival of Roman Catholicism in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ahdname of Milodra≈æ currently resides in Franciscans Monastery in Fojnica,ancient city in Central Bosnia.

Fun facts:
Jajce is Bosnian word for little egg;
Anƒëeo is Bosnian word for Angel;
Zvijezdoviƒá means Son of Star;

29,When did hairstyles take on a cosmetic purpose as opposed to a practical grooming practice?,"I‚Äôve always been curious about when and how personal expression and/or fashion conventions emerged. I believe there are marked anthropological and historical connotations for a society, or even particular members of that society, to engage in consciously cultivating their appearances. 

In specific, are there any records or establishing examples of when people became concerned about how their hair looked, started taking conscious steps to style it, dominant styles or ‚Äòlooks‚Äô developed etc? 

Im aware humans have been cutting their hair likely back into hunter gatherer days, if only for the purpose of convenience and avoiding irritation from hair in eyes/unwieldy amounts of it. When did this come to encompass an actual attitude towards fashion and aesthetics rather than a purely perfunctory task? 

I‚Äôve also often noticed that ancient cultures in media, be it from the Greeks and romans all the way to the renaissance, are often depreciated with men having long sometimes unkempt hair. Think the image of a night with long flowing locks that‚Äôs become synonymous with that image of medieval heroism/importance-did this have any truth to it? Or were you just as likely to witness someone from any one of these ancient cultures using hair gel and having a meticulous side part or spiked up hair like we might see in a more modern era? 

Finally, are there records of when these kind of pursuits became a full time occupation  in the vein of stylists, barbers, hairdressers? Having dedicated members of the community to manage appearances purely for appearances sake seems like the hallmark of a relatively comfortable niche of society if nothing else.

I appreciate r/history accommodating my weird shower thought question! Exited to find out more.

Personally I would say it set the precedent for the crusades that followed, which undoubtedly played a large part in influencing the shaping of the Middle East, however I am unaware as to what extent it influenced aspects such as trade, religion, infrastructure, politics, etc. within the Middle East.

Asking as I'm interested in the role of the crusades in the Middle East but don't really have much knowledge outside of the crusades themselves.

41,How did the Roman legions conquer the Greek phalanx?,"With this question I was always under the impression that the manipules flexibility was the driving force in cracking the Greek phalanx, where it would penetrate and crack small parts of the line and that would spread through the entire formation. Also the manipules were able to move much more freely which could out maneuver and flank the Greeks. This theory is what most of my video and literary research suggested.

However, recently, I was prompted by a video that brought up the question of the vast difference in reach between the sarissa pike and gladius, to think a little bit more on the subject. The video asserts that it was the superior tactical mindset and the brilliance of the Roman generals that are to be credited with the victory, not just the manipule style legions inherit superiority. 

The video is by the YouTubed metatron and while I disagree with some points I think it is a good video that brings up some interesting points. I tend to lean toward the former approach, but I see the merits of the latter theory.

76,One of the last Lithuanian partisans' speech from 1962.,"As today is March 11 and Lithuania celebrates its declaration of independence of 1990, I thought it would be appropriate to share a speech given by one of the last Lithuanian partisans, Juozapas Streikus - Stumbras, at his trial in 1962 (translated by me).

\----------

One of the last Lithuanian partisans' final words in court in 1962.

When he was allowed his final words, one of the last Lithuanian partisans Juozas Streikus talked for two hours. He accused. He did not defend himself, did not deny even obviously made up allegations. When the judge asked, ""Why did you kill soviet citizens?"" - Juozas replied: ""I did not kill anyone. We used the death sentence, based on our court-martial, and we punished not soviet citizens, but traitors. We did not shoot anyone who didn't serve the KGB, didn't betray the partisans, didn't kill their families, didn't burn our homes and send their own countrymen to Siberia. You dare accuse us?"" - asked the defendant. - ""Of what? Did my men and I invade the Russian expanse, did we, Lithuanians, send the Russians to uninhabitable northern lands? Did we attack you, robbed your homes? You were the ones who came to our lands, you stole our homeland, turned our homes to ashes, you shot at us. We only resisted, defended our lands, our freedom, we were forced to pick up the arms. What did you expect? You are killing us, and we have to stay quiet like sheep? We earn our bread with our own hands, we don't take it from the weak. And while we work, without straightening our backs, - you're making weapons, occupying entire countries, taking away what people have created. Yes, you enslaved us, those that you didn't have time to kill or deport to Siberia, me and my brother were the only ones left...in the forest. Others have already been killed, even their bodies mutilated... And you dare judge us? On what right? Tell me, who gave you the right to condemn us to death for defending our homes, our culture?

I know you will deal with me, but I'm telling you - Lithuania will be free. Our sacrifices, our fight will not be for nothing, and portraits of Lenin will not hang on Lithuanian walls forever. And our tricolor will fly once more. Today you are strong, armed, you've already declared the death sentence of the Lithuanian people, but you will never be able to kill our love for Lithuania, our belief and hope of surviving the red plague, staying alive. Your forced Bolshevism is foreign to us, no force will be able to enslave the spirit of a Lithuanian. People will suffer, maybe even comply with your commands, obey your directions and order, but will never accept your ideology, the people will curse you, there will be no respect left for you. You can turn an entire nation into a silent workforce, but it is not in your power to enslave our souls. You're murdering us, mocking everything that's sacred to us. We're defending, and this fight is not over and will not be over with the death of the last A≈ævinƒçiai forest partisan. We had the right to defend with every available tool. An occupied, enslaved, murdered nation will always be right, no matter what they use to defend themselves. You dare accuse me of fighting with a weapon? It seems I didn't shoot enough, it seems that not enough occupiers died in foreign lands if you're accusing those who are defending. Your truth is based on lies - even the words of your generals - lies. How long was I free? Two years? Was that truly freedom, when every step is watched, every word is heard? But even in those two years, I built houses, electricity stations, while in that time you killed and are killing even now. Even those that put down their weapons, even the defeated, you kill. What are you? You're quiet? Don't have anything to say?

Then I will answer: you will be defeated by your own lies, your created slavery, and there will come a day when Lithuania will live by its own means. Even though you've killed half the people of Lithuania, that day will come. That is the freedom you bring...That's the same morale you bring: look at your soldiers. Drunk thieves! What did they do with our innocent people? Can you count how many families, how many homes have been destroyed by your hand? And you're still trying to present us with accounts! There will come a time when you will be condemned by all the nations you enslaved! There will come a time when you will be judged, when you will have to answer to people and history for your crimes to small, enslaved lands. Where will you go with your weapons and sloth, when the entire world condemns wars, destroys weapons? I believe this day will come for Earth. How will you look into the eyes of justice then? Yes, today you are judging me, I am the condemned one... But in the future, the entire world will judge you. With all of your fetishes and communism fortresses. Even the word 'communism' will turn into a curse. Maybe there will be a day when you will finally open your eyes, seeing your black fields and inhuman generals, and will be scared of the monstrous war machine you're so proud of. And if any of you will still be alive, maybe you'll remember the words of the last Lithuanian partisan you heard here today. That is why I tell you again: Lithuania will not die with me.""


""I fought honourably: you do not beat the fallen man, as our parables say. Back then, we thought that your fight would be more honourable too...It's a shame our definitions of honour differ. Now I see: we should have acted differently, should have all rebelled, with all of our power: minds, patience, hatred and weapons. Every one of us - to the forests, every one of us should have prepared for the merciless battle: us or them...Maybe our fight wouldn't have been tarnished, maybe there wouldn't be bandits you placed in our forests, acting in the partisans' name. Maybe I wouldn't be judged today, and my nation wouldn't be enslaved. Instead of defending, we should have been chasing you, shooting you without any rules of an honourable fight, but we just defended. And when Lithuania understands this - it will be free.""


""I do not ask the occupants for forgiveness and do not regret anything, save one thing... We only taught our children to grow bread, plant trees, while we should have been teaching them to shoot more accurately, without remorse, because the occupants did not spare any of us. And they will not spare, and they will thieve and starve our nation, until it learns to defend itself as the bees defend their hive, until everyone meets the enemy with weapon in hand.""


""I do not ask for forgiveness - I defended that, which is forever sacred to me and my Lithuania. And now - murder me, that's what you do best. But never forget - our spilt blood will awaken the nation, will knock on every Lithuanians' heart, and then you will lose - you, the bringers of violence and death. You will lose because you have not done any good with your hands, your work and love, you have not created any good since the start of your bloody revolution, you only destroyed. The riches of a robbed country will make you neither wealthier nor stronger. I despise you. And in death, I do not regret living my short life as I did: I defended my homeland, I loved Lithuania and I die free - you will not be able to kill these feelings.""

20,Effect of greater accuracy and skill with crossbows and muskets of the 16th century?,"As far as I understand it, crossbows and early firearms were mainly effective because any random recruit could easily learn how to load, aim, and fire. You could amass a ton of expendable troops with almost no training and pelt the opposing side with volleys of ammunition, which didn't need to be particularly accurate. 

However, I'm interested to know just how much _more_ effective a crossbow or smoothbore musket could have been in the hands of a ""master."" Assuming that one has trained since childhood in the understanding and application of pre-rifling mechanical weaponry, is the difference in effectiveness (particularly in a minor skirmish) notable at all? Could someone with a lifetime of experience learn to fire more accurately with a smoothbore musket, or was the soldier's own skill with aiming less important before rifling was introduced? 

In other words, imagining a scenario where a small group of the world's most experienced musketeers were up against a much larger force of poorly trained but well-equipped soldiers, how might that have turned out? (Assume for argument's sake that the weather is perfect and both sides are equally prepared, beginning combat with equal cover at a distance of 100 yards).

I'd also like some reliable sources of numbers that I keep finding contradicting reports of. Mainly, I'd like to know a rough estimation of the accurate range of crossbows and muskets, and how they might have compared to one another in the early 16th century, especially at a range of 100 yards or less.

30,I interviewed my grandmother about living under Japanese occupation during WWII in Northeastern China (Manchukuo),"My grandmother passed away a couple of days ago, and as I was looking for things to remember her by I found this short interview I did with her for a middle school history project. I am so glad to be able to hear her voice again, especially as this was done before a stroke had damaged her mental state, so she still spoke in the lively manner I remember. I was 14 at the time so it really wasn't a well-structured interview, but I hope that some of you will still be able to find bits of it interesting. The interview was originally in Mandarin Chinese.


(M)e: Where were you living when the Japanese invaded China during World War II?

(H)er: I was living in Jilin city, Jilin province at the time.

M: How old were you then?

H: I was ... around 11.

M: Who were you living with?

H: I was living with my parents.

M: Were you studying at the time?

H: Yes, I was studying at the Changyi District Elementary School of Jilin City.

M: Was it hard to acquire food back then?

H: Aiya, it was really difficult back then to find food, because we were living under poverty. 

M: How was it difficult?

H: Well, we never knew when we our next meal would be. We would rarely get to eat any grains, all we had were the Japanese rationed acorn flour and soya beans. 

M: Other than your rations, would you still go out and try to find some extra things to eat?

H: Um... we didn't have to.

M: So were the rations enough?

H: No! We just ate a minimal amount.

M: What other changes did the Japanese bring about to your life, other than the food? Like was there anything you had to be careful of when walking on the streets?

H: Aiya the Japanese would always barge into civilian homes to take things and [rape] women, so we all dug cellars into the ground. Once the Japanese arrive, we would all hide in the cellars, and only come out after they have left.

M: Did they come to your village often?

H: They came around very often. The first family to see them would strike on the metal basins, and all families who heard it will strike on their metal basins too, and very soon you will hear whole streets of people striking on metal basins. Everyone would run into the cellars then.

M: Well, were you able to make any happy memories during such dark times?

H: Happy memories? Yeah! When they surrendered in 1945, all of the Japanese soldiers had to leave behind their weapons, properties, everything they owned - they weren't allowed to bring any of those with them. They weren't allowed to wear their original clothes either, they had to wear what the Chinese government gave them, and line up in long queues at the train station, to wait to get on the trains and get out of here.

M: What did the clothes look like?

H: It was just normal clothes that the government had given them. Kind of looks like the pajamas we have now.

M: Then, were there any especially sad memories you have?

H: Sad memories... of course I had many sad memories.

M: Especially sad memories!

H: Especially sad... Well because we didn't have much to eat, we went to the shipping yards to take things. This was when the Japanese were almost set to retreat, so the shipping yard was a total chaos, so we went there to see if we can find anything to eat. When we came back, your great grandfather, so my father, caught the typhoid fever. I was the saddest then.

M: Did you have any medicine for him to eat?

H: We didn't have money, so we sold some things to buy a small amount of medicine for him at the market.

M: Have you ever seen the Japanese soldiers up close?

H: Yeah I have, I have seen them. Didn't I say, they would raid all the families and homes, from door to door, to take things. Sometimes they would also take women away with them, and after doing very inhumane things to them, sometimes they would let them go home again. We were children then, so they didn't care too much for us, so we were able to see them. 

M: What about the Chinese soldiers? Did you ever see them?

H: I've seen a lot of Guomindangs. When they would battle the Japanese, it always happened at night. They would fight at night. During the day the Japanese soldiers would go around causing havoc and abusing us civilians. 

M: Did the battles affect the civilians?

H: Of course they did! We don't dare to go outside, we would just stay in our houses. There would always be smoke, or the sound of gunfire. There was once they threw a bomb, and it landed on a small three-story building at the Jilin train station. This happened during the day, I saw this with my own eyes.

M: Then... during this entire period, was there any event, or episode, that you really want to share with me?

H: Episode... once the Japanese had to all assemble at the train station (for their retreat), they were all lined up. Because our family's lives were very difficult then, so I took a kettle and went to the train station and filled it up with cold water, and I would sell the water to the Japanese. They would use the water to wash their face, or just as drinking water. I would sell them a bowl of water for 0.01 RMB at the time. It felt really good.

M: Why did it feel good? You were helping the Japanese!

H: I gave them free water, but they had to give me money in return! And I could use that money to buy other things.

M: Well, then do you have anything you want to tell us, the younger generation, about WWII? Or war in general?

H: Aiya, to the younger generation... I guess I just want to tell you guys to love your country. To protect your country. If something like this happens again, put down some other things, and join the army, fight them! Just do whatever you can to protect your family, your country, and the people. 

M: Finally, is there anything I didn't ask about, but you think you would like to share?

H: I think... I'm just not going to tell you anything else.

M: Come on come on!

H: I don't know what to say anymore!

M: Just one more!

H: Okay, fine. Let me think. Okay. Let me tell you. At the time, when the Chinese soldiers surrounded Changchun (the then capital of Manchukuo), the Japanese had already surrendered. The people who were in Changchun, because they were surrounded, food couldn't be transported in, so after being surrounded for a while, they ran out of food. So these people, they would trade the gold rings they had, for food. They would trade their gold rings for soya beans. Each gold ring could be exchanged for 10, maybe 20, soya beans at the time. And they would feed on those. And in the very end, when they really couldn't stand it anymore, they left Changchun and fled to Jilin, where we were. I saw all these kids, maybe they were young soldiers, they all had really big heads and extremely skinny limbs, they all looked like they only had bones underneath their skin. They looked very pitiful.  




My grandmother's name was Cui Shuqin. She suffered from a stroke during my final year of high school, and my parents did not tell me about her situation until I finished my final exams because they didn't want me to worry. I have been studying abroad, seeing my Grandmother for only a week max during Winter and Summer breaks, and I did not get a chance to have a proper conversation with her after I turned 18. Her health, both mental and physical, deteriorated very quickly since the stroke. I was very close to her, because my parents were both very busy working when I was a kid. I wish I had more time to talk to her as an adult. I also wish I can properly remember all the stories she had told me about about the Japanese occupation, about the Chinese civil war, about the Cultural Revolution, about her family and her life. My grandmother was a very strong and optimistic person, and she always tried to live her life to the fullest. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone for taking the time to read about my grandmother's memories, and my memories of her. It means so much to me to be able to share her experiences with you. Thank you so much.",history,1520099285,xavier_x007x,57,979,True,2018-03-03

&gt;In 1990 America and the Soviet Union returned to the talks. It was decided that by 2030 America would receive $674 million. A year later the USSR collapsed. But in 1993 the Russian government announced its succession to the debts and soon paid for all the goods that the USSR had received in accordance with the Lend-Lease bill.

I can only assume that this has to do with a country's credit rating, but I'm not sure and I find it odd that 50 years later and after the collapse of the government that originally accepted the deal that this would effect Russia's credit. If this is correct can someone explain the reasoning behind this?

I ask because I just came back and recall there being a memorial to Australian soldiers in Beer Sheva, mostly for WWII, but it also commemorated pretty much anybody who died or sacrificed defending jews in the 20th century.

Anyway, in my teenage years I read a horrible but entertaining historical novella series of Casca by Barry Sadler. They are not good books- to the point you can sometimes find typos, but w/e, they are enjoyable. Their historical accuracy is... well, crap, but it did have some mildly interesting ideas.

Anyway, in the book focusing on Casca's return to Israel and fighting in the Six Days war, it went into odd detail on Israel's recruitment methods, and it remained consistent as he was fighting that it was often alongside other American-Jews, which is the case in the Israeli army- you are often placed alongside similar nationality when possible.

Anyway, not to drone on, but this makes me wonder how many American-Israelis or American-Jews fought in the war. The book purports, probably exagerated, that a fair few Jews from the Americas and around the world went to Israel to fight, and then effectively went home respectively.

And... this is something that is a part of modern Jewish culture.

While there I encountered many, many people who had fought in that conflict. I find it interesting a text, even if garbage, suggests that you could find just as many in say, Brooklyn or New Jersey, Florida or California.

I'm more than well-aware of the foreign reactions to *another* anti-royalist revolt, execution of a monarch, and abolition of a throne little less than a century and a half after the English did so; the powers of Europe were *terrified* of the French Revolution - the English especially, ironically enough - and at the mere prospect of a king being able to be deposed and beheaded by the commonfolk, let alone the entire concept of kingship being thrown out the window. It's my understanding that the monarchies of Europe were already arranging their armies in preparation to march into Paris and restore the Bourbons even before the Revolutionaries marched into the Rhine - which I'm led to believe, from some sources, to have mostly been a preemptive move of defense in regards to the just mentioned matter.

But were there any such reactions to the English when they did the same? Were the kings of Europe readying armadas to invade British shores before Monck rode into London and restored the monarchy without any foreign intervention?

23,US Mexican Relations before the Mexican American War and the Forgotten Second Texas War of Independence.,"I've been doing some research regarding the inter war period between Texas securing its independence and the American Mexican War. 1836 - 1846, roughly a 10 year period.

Mexico was a nation in deep financial debt.  In 1838 Mexico survived a brief French Invasion for debts and damages to French Property in Mexico.  The United States was largely in favor of the French as Mexico refused to recognize Texas as an Independent Republic. 

Some interesting facts about the time period that are not mentioned in US history classes.  For the most part the Mexican American War is portrayed as a War of Aggression with American being the bullying nation. Some interesting facts.

The Mexican government refused to recognize Texas Independence after the battle of San Jacinto and many politicians and generals in Mexico sought to regain the Texas territory. It was largely thought that regaining Texas would help repay Mexico's debts and regain lost honor and nationalism from an embarrassing defeat in 1836. 

The Mexican Army under General Mariano Arista organized an invasion of Texas in 1842 and succeeded in occupying San Antonio.  The Army was made up of around 1,000 infantry and 200 Cherokee volunteer scouts. The Mexican Army was supported by French and British mercenaries and supplied heavily by British Arms dealers. 

General Santa Anna remained in Exile, and was a harsh critic of the invasion.  He saw the invasion as a reason for the United States to attack Mexico to secure the border between Texas and Mexico, and a reason to annex Texas.  

The United States did not broker peace between both nations (Mexico and Texas), the Texas ranks increased rapidly in 1842 to counter the invasion.  The Texas army under Matthew Caldwell succeeded in driving out the Mexican Army. The United States provided arms, recruited men and sent officers to support the Texas counter offensive. 

The Mexican Army withdrew from Texas, largely due to other regions of the Mexican Republic that were in rebellion in the South and pressure from the United States to withdrawal.

After 1843 Texas would lobby for United States support to join the Union.  Mexico offered the USA recognition of Texas as an Independent republic as long as Texas was not admitted the United States Union. Following Texas's admission as a State, the border was heavily disputed between both American and Mexico.  With Mexico's increasingly worsened financial situation the United States took an opportunity to purchase all territories of North America West. Mexico obviously declined the offer leading to border skirmishes that would start the Mexican American War. 

I was under the misunderstanding for decades that the Mexican American War was a War of greed and American Manifest Destiny to control the continent. There were obvious circumstances that led to the War.  Most of which were the national sovereignty of Texas, and Mexico and the United States (after 1845).

In the book, Jack Weatherford and his team travel to Mongolia, and more specifically to the ancient homeland where Temujin (Genghis) was born, so as to uncover some more historical accounts of his life and the early days of the Mongol horde.   

The book is very centered around the idea that although the Mongols were brutal(ly efficient) in their conquests, they eventually paved the road for a vast new network of trade and tech sharing between the often isolated eastern kingdoms and the medieval west.  
  
Most of the details of Temujins life are recounted in the book, including how he rose to unite the Mongol tribes all the way to how he became the ruler of one of the largest empires the world has ever seen.
  
It's a really great book, and from my knowledge and in my opinion doesn't suffer from bias or a heavy revisionist perspective like some other historical works do.",history,1518927029,WhaleSalesman,11,10,True,2018-02-17

88,What specific roles did my Grandfather play in history?,"My Grandfather passed away in 1991.  I knew my Grandfather was really intelligent but never thought much about it.  It wasn‚Äôt until I got older that I wanted to find out more about him and his contributions to the science community. My mother and my aunt have tried several avenues to get information and the details are lacking.  

He was a quiet, unassuming man, though, he spoke 13 different languages including Morse code.  When I visited my grand parents‚Äô house as a child, my Grandfather was always sitting in his study, reading.  I would sneak into the basement to see his shortwave radios that were as big as a roll top desk.  Presents from my grandparents were always scientific related.

My mother was surprised by some of the letters the family received after his passing. Other scientists talked a lot about his involvement and impact he had on them throughout their careers.

Here‚Äôs what I know: He worked on the development of not only the  Manhattan Project but also an electric car at Ford Labs (before electric cars were a thing).  I‚Äôve been gifted his paperwork and I‚Äôm seeking to know more.  He has many published papers but I‚Äôm really trying to dig more into the stories. 

What was the fight about at Ford?  What part did he play with the electric car?  What was his role in the Manhattan Project.  We know he was 1 of 12 American scientists that worked together.  What did they accomplish for the project?

Also, the oil supplies were in Azerbaijan, people were evacuated to Kazakhstan, and human resources were taken from all over the Union. My country had a population of 3 million people at that time, yet 1 million people were sent to fight, and 600 thousand people have died.

19,"Slavery in medieval Serbia, Bosnia and Dubrovnik","So, I have recently started looking into this subject. Slavery existed in both medieval Serbia and Bosnia, there are references to slaves in the Du≈°an's code, where it is stated the slaves of the nobility were their eternal heritage, and that only a member of the noble family can free a family slave. However, there is still some debate on whether or not the slaves from Du≈°an's Code (called otroci) were actual slaves or not. Their status, judging from the Code, is similar to the status of slaves though. On the other hand, judging from other medieval Serbian documents, we see that the term otrok can be used to describe a servant, a trusted man, a feudal serf. It seems that the very term otrok was used to describe a wide variety of things, and that we can't simply say that otroks are slaves. However, slavery (actual slavery) was also widespread in the region along the sea, where there was a developed slave trade network, one of the main centers on the eastern side was Dubrovnik, although there were other cities, Kotor for example that participated in the trade. Most slaves were Slavs. From the 12th to the 14th century the trade was at its peak, and women and children were especially wanted as slaves. There were also bands of the ropci (slave-raiders) who abducted people into slavery. The Catholic Church also played a part in the whole affair, accepting slavery if the slaves were schismatics or heretics. St. Antoninus of Florence even said that the slaves can't be freed even if they accept baptism and become Catholics. Slaves were often members of the Church of Bosnia, and sometimes even the rulers of Bosnia sold their people into slavery. Of course, war captives were also sold.

In Dubrovnik 66% of slaves came from Bosnia, 7% from Usora, 6% from the regions around Sana, 5% from Hum, 4,5% from Travunia, 4,5% from the Vrbas region, 2% from Syrmia, 1,5% from Croatia, 1% from Po≈æega, and the rest came from regions such as Trebinje, although there were slaves from even more distant regions like Hungary. Slave traders also had various background. A lot were Ragusans (from Dubrovnik), others were from Hum, Trebinje, Konavli, Bosnia, Gacko, Rudnik, Nevesinje and from other coastal cities like Split and Trogir. In Bosnia the trade was centered around the Drijeva square near Gabela. Slaves had a huge role in Dubrovnik, Slavic slaves were sometimes used as teachers of Slavic language, and the presence of slaves actually eased the pressure on the noble ladies, who no longer had to do domestic duties and chores (the slaves did it), so they turned to their other duty: childbirth. Many slaves were women, mostly Orthodox or from the Bosnian Church. The price for slaves differed: 27-28 gold coins for women, 30 for men. However, you could sell a young woman for as high as 48 coins, and a young man for 50 coins. More prized were foreign slaves, for example for a Tatar, Circassian, Russian or a Saracen women the minimal price was 42 coins. Russian or Circassian women were described as gentle and more beautiful, while Tatar women were described as stronger and endurable.

Eventually, many cities banned slavery and/or slave trade (Split in 1373, Trogir and Korƒçula in 1397, Dubrovnik in 1416), but it was not respected. For example, in Dubrovnik in 1445 Marin de Bona and Benedetto Magrino agreed to sell 12-15 slaves. In the middle of the 15th century, many Greeks, Tatars, Russians, Muslims and blacks were sold as slaves in Dubrovnik, to the Turks, Italians, Catalans etc. After the fall of Serbia in 1459 and the fall of Skadar in 1479, many people came to Dubrovnik willing to sell themselves as slaves. Unlike in the ancient period, most slaves didn't work in the field, but were instead personal servants. The need for slaves increased in the aftermath of the Black Death, which eliminated much of the population and many of the servants. The Ottomans themselves were slavers, although slave routes changed with their arrival, with many slaves being taken to the Levant instead to the Adriatic.

41,Top 10 most important Historical Events of all time,"Many events in human history have had their impact on the future and shifted in one way or another. Some of them were beneficial for mankind while others lead to heavy losses of human blood and fortune, without any sustainable result. The 10 most important historical events of all time could be the ones that are described below. 
The Life of Muhammad
Irrespective of whether you are a Muslim or not, you simply cannot deny the influence he had on the human history. He pulled the tribes of Arab from the darkness to the Islamic Golden Age. The culture of that region flourished and many advancements were seen in scientific fields like Mathematics in that era. Concepts like zero, decimal and algebra were discovered during that phase. The impression of his personality can be identified by a simple fact that Islam has been one of the largest religions of the world ever since its birth. 

The Reformation
It could be considered the greatest event in the entire history of Europe. Prior to this, Roman Catholic Church had ultimate control over the government and the people. This was the time when learned men started to raise questions about the actions of the church in comparison to Bible. The religious text distributed to common people as a result of this campaign and the power of Catholic diminished gradually. It was also the root cause behind America‚Äôs expansion.

American Revolution
This was the War of Independence in United States against the military Rebellion of Great Britain. The basic reason for this revolt was the direct tax law passed in 1756. Dutch, Spain and French supported this as they were supplying weapons to rebels. They also did invade physically alongside Britain. The war came to an end finally after the treaty of Paris.

Beginning of British Empire in India
Robert Clive was sent initially as a civil servant of The East India Company but was transferred to military wing and returned to England with a lot of cash. During his 1st tenure, he won Battle of Plassey. He came back to India with his 2nd tenure and organized British Colony in Sub-continent although French interests were also there.

Seven Year War
It could be called the first Global War of the world. It was initiated by the British intervention in the Ohio valley, which was under French control. It was fought in three continents including the Caribbean Islands. France had complete domination in North America and British wanted to get their hands of Fur trade. It ended following a peace treaty in 1763.

Acts of Union
This act was passed by England and Scotland in 1707 that gave birth to Great Britain. This made them same monarchy but legislatures were different. Earlier, the English tried to invade Scotland and failed pretty miserably. 31 commissioners were selected from both countries to negotiate the issue and a positive result came out in the end.

Life of Jesus
The effect of Jesus‚Äôs life on this world could be imagined by considering the dating system that we use till date. He never travelled much and his teachings spread vastly, after he left this world. This eventually led to Romans becoming Christians. Christianity is still one of the largest religions around the world.

World War I
It began following the assassination of Archduke Franz. War was declared on Serbia by Austria-Hungry. It redrew the maps of Asia and Europe as 10 million people were martyred in a span of 4 years. Many deadliest weapons were introduced in this war and League of Nations was formed to prevent any future incident.

World War II
League of Nations failed to deliver as Second World War was fought with people from 30 different countries. Most advanced weapons including nuclear weapon was used in this destructive event. Casualty count was as high as 80 million United Nations was set up in order to stop this anarchy. The entire dynamics of the world changed following it.

New Zealand gave the Right to Vote to Women
This is one of the biggest steps for women rights that was taken in 1893 by Lord Glasfow. It did lead to a huge debate as many people argued that women should not have any part in politics. But, governor stood firm to his decision and this amazing change took place. America and Britain followed this tradition in 1920 and 1928, respectively.

49,How Did SS Officers Get To Their Positions?,"Just before World War 2 and During World War 2 SS officers (to me) seemingly came out of nowhere, did whatever they did be it killing soviets or Jews, and then either got put on trial or went their own paths after the war.

Usually, to become an officer in any military you go to college, graduate from some training school, and then get a commission, however it might be different for the SS officers.

If anyone knows how that worked or if what it think is right is right, please let me know.

Thank you.

Edit: Okay. So from what I gather candidates for officer positions were either directly appointed, had gone through the hitler youth program, or were chosen to be officers from their experience being enlisted soldiers. They were then sent to these cadet schools were they were trained to be officers. They would then get their commissions and went their separate ways. Feel free to add onto any of this.

My Oma was born in England pre ww2 and I‚Äôve always found it kind of fascinating how regimented her tea drinking schedule was, every day after lunch and every night after desert, 2 pots a day every single day.

What inspired the english in specific to take up drinking tea so religiously? Was there any significant events that made tea so popular? Or was it just a slow cultural adoption over hundred‚Äôs of years? I know about the boston tea party, but from my understanding it was only such a big deal because the British already loved tea and needed it to be shipped over, but were events like this linked to the cultural inauguration of tea?

Also i know many other countries are big Tea drinkers, but as i have an oldschool english family member it is the most relatable to me :)   ",history,1518356148,boumans15,20,0,True,2018-02-11

First time poster, long time lurker.

Me and my girlfriend are in Vilnius (Lithuania) over the weekend.

Yesterday we went on a ghost tour where the guide described the event of Napoleon and his troops arriving back from their failed campaign in Russia.

Can someone explain why Napoleon decided to push into Russia when he didn't have good enough equipment or supplies to handle the winter?

Sweden and France were allies at that point, so it would be feasible to assume that Napoleon had heard or our (I'm Swedish) failed campaigns into the country. 

Russia employed the same tactics as they did two or three times to us, burning down anything that could help sustain our progress (farms, houses, food) whilst withdrawing their armies. 

So how did an experienced commander like Napoleon manage to make the same errors as our commanders and others before them?

Why didn't he simply wait a year to gather more supplies for his campaign? What was the significance of taking Mowcow, except for it being the capital?

I know this is a bit cliche but my personal favorite is Herodotus, as he was one of the pioneers of historiography and his method seems really out of the box (in present context) as he was really a cosmopolitan because of his various travels to other countries just for the sake of writing what he himself saw in a specific region and no one else's. I also admire his non-Greek approach when writing history; in a time where Greeks were basically the strongest civilization of its time Herodotus did not keep such a xenophobic mindset in terms of writing history and made sure he also included non-Greeks in his works. His method of separating myth from fact was also revolutionary as religion was a big part of Greek life and yet he did not let this get in his way of his search for the facts of human life.",history,1517657276,Dream_Soda,7,6,True,2018-02-03

Why I didn't find this Subreddit sooner is beyond me and the answer to what I'm going to ask might be embarrassingly obvious. 

There was a period in which British women weren't allowed to inherit property or money (?) from their dead husbands or fathers. 

Did this continue for the entire of the Victorian and Edwardian periods respectively? What if both parents died and their orphaned daughter was the only next of kin? Would their assets then go to the state?

Dear Dad &amp; Mom
	You will probably have started down or have decide not to come when this letter gets home. Even though I suggested that you didn‚Äôt come I kinda hope you‚Äôre coming. I know you must be planning on it. I have hotel reservations made and either way you decide things will work out alright. I can‚Äôt hardly wait for this next week to pass till I can see you. I had to send that night letter through to let you know conditions here. The graduation will consist of having our names read, walking up &amp; receiving our wings and commission papers. Taxis are supposed to be forbidden to come to the field, and the only busses running are G.d. busses for service men. So as much as I‚Äôd love to have you come it would be a pretty tiring and rough deal.  I‚Äôm so undecided as to which would be best that I don‚Äôt know what to suggest. I got your air-mail letter after I wired. Write again and let me know what you finally decide. 
	I‚Äôve made plans for either way so I can see you almost as soon if you decide not to come. I have a reservation on braniff and united airlines to get to Salt Lake on Wed. 9th and if some priority puts me off I still have an alternate. I can get a B-34 to Denver and will be quite sure of getting a B-17 the same day from the Lowry field to salt lake. I‚Äôll be seeing you soon.
Lots of love, Ralph

P.S I got your wire Dad. I think it will be best that way I‚Äôll do my best to be in Salt Lake Wed. I‚Äôll wire and let you know Monday or Tuesday.
P.P.S I met a very lovely girl at church Sunday. She is from the BYU and a resident of Houston. Last Sunday was the first chance I‚Äôve had to go to church here. I met 5 old Y students and knew most of them. Some swell folks from ? and Idaho. One girl that was in some of my classes is a missionary here. I almost like seeing someone from home.

Dear Charles Campbell:
	Have a minute between ‚Äújobs‚Äù and want so much to again tell you how truly beautiful your song was on Sunday morning. Whatever your own thought is regarding your voice and its production accept the fact that it is unusually beautiful as to quality. ‚Äì A very special gift to you ‚Äì and from you. I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúthe holy city‚Äù sung numerous times but rarely with your particular understanding and beauty. Please believe me- it‚Äôs just an innate something that eludes verbal expression. A spiritual quality so rarely found in ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù singers. Please don‚Äôt ever lose it. 
	You will find opportunities to sing come your way, if at all possible accept them and let your voice ring out in the songs you love to sing ‚Äì there will always be some receptive souls in your audiences who will be happier because they heard you ‚Äì and the message out bring in this way. There are plenty of boogie-woogie artists, etc. abroad in the world and in the service but too few of you type. So ‚Äì ‚Äúdo your stuff‚Äù
	I‚Äôm taking the liberty of enclosing two little leaflets which helped me so much. Trust you will find them interesting too. 
	On your journey through this particular phase of your life ‚Äì in an activity which I‚Äôm sure none of us would chose ‚Äì but which we find ourselves in ‚Äì probably for excellent reasons ‚Äì I know for you that ‚Äúthe light of god surrounds you; the love of god enfolds you; the power of god protects you‚Äô the presence of god watches over you and keeps you safe and secure.‚Äù
					Cordially, Alice N. ?
P.S hope all your wishes come true &amp; you‚Äôre sent where you want to go!



Dear Mom &amp; Dad,
	I‚Äôve been pretty busy for the last few days. I‚Äôve never walked so far in my life. Our BOQ is down on a nice little lake about a mile and a half from the line and the Tech. training buildings. Our schedule is pretty well filled up too. 
	I really believe I‚Äôm going to like heavy bomb. We‚Äôre already started flying and a B-24 is really a good ship. I had three propellers feathered today and was holding my altitude with only one engine turning over. Anyone who tells you a 24 can‚Äôt fly on one engine is wrong. I met art Hubermenth? on the street the other night. It was surely swell to see him. He hasn‚Äôt changed a bit. If I can I usually get away from the field Sunday I‚Äôm going in and go to church with him. Dad, to be really honest with you and me too a car wouldn‚Äôt be the most practical thing to get right now. A person almost needs one to get around in and a lot of the fellows have them but the fact remains that I‚Äôll be going over in about 5 months and a week from today; unless they make an instructor out of me here which I doubt. What would you advise me to do Dad? I looked at a lot of cars and about the best deals are 40‚Äô fords &amp; Chevy‚Äôs at $1000 &amp; one 40 DeSoto good shape, tires, and accessories, at $1100 with a down payment of $500 and 15 months at about $46.78 per month. Costing about $110 to finance for 15 months. Please write or wire and let me know what you think I ought to plan on. There is a big possibility that I‚Äôll go to Salt Lake from here. There or Fresno Calif. Write soon and tell me what to do
Love, Ralph.



Dear Mom &amp; Dad,
	I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt write more often to let you know what I am doing and how I am. You can bet I‚Äôm in no mischief though, I‚Äôm kept much too busy for anything like that. So far I‚Äôm getting along OK I guess. The B-24‚Äôs are really good ships and I think I‚Äôm going to learn to really like them. There is so much to one them though that you can‚Äôt appreciate until you learn all about what makes it tick. Would you believe it there is some 28 electrical motors alone on one of these ships. Just to learn all about them and their functions is quite a ?toll
	I guess I won‚Äôt fly for a day or two. I hurt my thumb pretty bad. The doctor x-rayed it and found it wasn‚Äôt broken so that‚Äôs good. My hand is pretty sore and it takes two good hands to handle this ship. The controls have 75 lbs. Tension and it‚Äôs a man‚Äôs job to pull one of these baby‚Äôs into a 60 degree bank without losing altitude. I went to church with art the second Sunday I was here. We went out to dinner together and had a swell time. I really like the car dad. It‚Äôs in swell shape and I intend to keep it that way. The tires are beauties I sure do appreciate you helping me but it. I don‚Äôt intend to do a lot of excessive driving in it, however, Amarillo is about 250 miles from here and I plan on saving gas and driving up to see Tod if I can ever get a weekend off. It‚Äôs a long way but I think it would be well worth it before I leave Texas.
	I‚Äôm sorry about the missing pictures dad. I guess it was just a misunderstanding. I tried to pay ?oren before I kept (that was before you gave me the check) and he absolutely refused to take the money. And invested that I keep it and send it to them after I got here. He said as far as everything was concerned it was the same as paid. It was kind of a dirty trick to refuse to give the pictures to Roberto because they weren‚Äôt paid for. I sent them the money I hope it‚Äôs all straightened out now. Please write often
	Love Ralph.
P.S I got a letter from Tod. He says he‚Äôs doing ok. Excuse the scrawling I‚Äôm writing in a hurry so I can get to class.

Dear Mom &amp; Dad, 
	I‚Äôve got to fly a mission tomorrow so this will probably be short as I need the sleep. I wish I were there to help you with that new fi truck too dad. I know it really must be tough to get help. I guess you‚Äôll really miss Tod this year. When I get my fifty in I‚Äôll see if I can come back and give you a hand. I hope so. 
	Dad, I‚Äôm sorry you felt so bad about my buzzing. It was very foolish. There really isn‚Äôt any justification in doing it just for fun but it‚Äôs just something everyone has to cut loose and do once in a while. There are times here when knowing how to hit the deck low and fast will save your life and the life of those mine boys riding with you. 
	It isn‚Äôt pleasant to see the realities of a war. I‚Äôm not saying this so you‚Äôll worry more because I know how you must worry about me now. I just believe I should let you know just what the score is. One of the finest chaps I know is a tail gunner on my buddy‚Äôs crew. They were flying right next to me yesterday and I saw the tail end of his ship blow up and disintegrate from a direct flak blast. That isn‚Äôt often but it does happen. The chances of coming back are far better than those of going down. The only thing everyone can do is know the rules of the game, whether the game is flying, religion as just loving in itself; and play the game the best I can by sticking to the rules. That way regardless of what happens if you‚Äôve tried our best to do the right thing things will turn out for the best.
	Dad, I‚Äôve seen the worst an enemy can hand out to us and I do know that praying helps. You don‚Äôt pray ant because you‚Äôre too busy but when you see it coming you put a lot of trust into your heavenly father. We came back yesterday with the hydraulic system for the flaps, landing gear and brakes shot out. We set her down safe and no one had a scratch: I know that it was with the help of the lord that we were able to do that. Don‚Äôt worry too much. I plan on getting my fifty. Please write often &amp; write long letters.
	Hello farmers &amp; fermis love, Ralph


Dear mom and dad,
	Guess what, you know how you wouldn‚Äôt ever let me buy a motorcycle. Well, here‚Äôs the payoff. When we got back from a mission two days ago I went to town and looked up a P-38 pilot who had a motorcycle he wanted to sell me. I agreed on $200 as I could easily get that out of it if I leave here. Well, I came back out to the field and requested a partial pay as I haven‚Äôt had my pay for two months. Captain Janesh, my squadron commander asked me what the score was. I told him I wanted a $200 partial pay to buy me a motorcycle. Well here‚Äôs the payoff. We had just gotten back from a mission and after flying through the soup to get there, &amp; through the flak &amp; coming back through that stuff &amp; making a forced landing on someone else‚Äôs landing strips he told me I couldn‚Äôt buy the motorcycle because it‚Äôs too dangerous. Mom, I guess I just wasn‚Äôt cut out for anything as dangerous as a motorcycle. And to think I thought ‚Äúha, mom can‚Äôt stop me from buying this motorcycle now. Well, its 2030 and I‚Äôve got to go on another mission tomorrow I‚Äôll write some more when I get back. I‚Äôll try to get some pictures to send you. Please take some and send them to me.



17 Nov. 1944
Dear Mom &amp; Dad,
	It ain‚Äôt the heat nor the blistered feet, nor the meals of spam in place of meat, nor the butter like lard, nor our turn at guard, none of these is as half as hard as to jolt in after all the sweat and a cheery voice says ‚Äúno mail yet.‚Äù 
	And it ain‚Äôt the breeze, like a dragon‚Äôs sneeze, that pecks the kids and weakens the knees nor the dirt in your gun nor the broiling sun. These are forgotten when day is done but our voices fail and our faces pale as we draw a blank when it‚Äôs time for mail.
	He can stand the flies and the sand in our eyes, the orders, the rumors, the truth, and the lies, the mosquitos swarm and the water warm and the warts that reek of chloroform what takes our light and makes throats tight are the letters somebody didn‚Äôt write.
	I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have sent the poem but it was so true I couldn‚Äôt resist. The mail has been reaching me though and I‚Äôve been getting quite a few letters. Some get here in as few as ten to twelve days. There however are still straggling in from September. I‚Äôve got to go to bed so I‚Äôll quit. I‚Äôm tower officer tomorrow and I‚Äôll have plenty of time so I‚Äôll write more then.
							Love, Ralph



20 Nov. 1944
Dear Dad, I got your letter today saying you were sorry for not writing. It made me feel kind of ashamed of myself for writing such a hasty letter the other morning just because I didn‚Äôt get a letter. I know you‚Äôre a lot busier there than I am here and I find it hard to sit down and write instead of hitting the bed when I‚Äôm through for the day. I know what kind of a deal you must have there this fall with no more help than you have. There‚Äôs really not much of a load to carry here dad. 54% below zero over the target and pounding through an eight to nine hour flight do get tiresome but there are hundreds of other guys doing the same thing. It may sound a bit funny and may not be exactly the right thing but I look at it this way. There‚Äôs a little white kind of paper in operations that has my name on it and 35 squares. I‚Äôm sorta living right there on that piece of paper. Every time when I come back from a mission no matter how rough it was or how much we got shot up I feel good when my whole crew is OK and we walk in and see another one of those white squares colored red. We got 18 of them colored and 17 more and we‚Äôll be seeing the ones we love at home. Of course besides just finishing our missions all of us like to feel as though were helping to finishing this thing as fast as possible. Dad. I find the things that occupy my mid most are plain ordinary things of life. I want to come home just to live for the joy of living &amp; doing [what] I want to get up in the morning, do a good hard day‚Äôs work, eat a good meal at a good family table, say hello to neighbors, shoot pheasants, walk out through a pretty field of spuds, drive to town through the snow, go to church on Sunday with my dad, wrestle with the boys and tease mom and the girls, sing in the choir, have a family dinner together on thanksgiving, go fishing, haul more beans with my truck than the next guy can with his, hug my mom, marry the sweetest girl in the world, do as fine a job raising a family as my dad has, build a house and help to make it a home; a million things like that are what I want to live for dad. When I hear a beautiful piece of music that‚Äôs what it says, and when I pray those are the things I ask my heavenly father to let me do. I know your faith and prayers are always with me and I hope I can live up to the kind of life you meant for me. I know the mail is pretty bad and how busy you are so I‚Äôll try to have more patience hereafter, and I‚Äôll try to write a little more regularly too. Dad I pray for the lord to forgive us of the things we do wrong and to help us to live worthy of the great blessings we have and thank him very much for my parents. Love, Ralph

0,Regarding pre-industrial era river crossing operations,"
Here's some thoughts and questions, regarding river crossing operations done by troops in medieval / renaissance era.

Modern military would usually go for pontoon bridges and boats when crossing rivers. Or more likely, they probably already have a bridge over the area, be it broken or not, so they could easily fix it and move on.

Rivers were there before modern times, so a question arises. How did people did it back then?

So a quick Wikipedia check on Pontoon bridges reveals that they were in use by Ancient Chinese, as early as 9th or 8th century BC, or even earlier(author says unlikely). Rome also had same idea, so I assume people had some idea to how to cross small rivers, at least those who would be influenced easily by those two powers : Asia and Europe / Middle-Eastern people.

However, some rivers were probably too wide to be crossed by pontoon bridges, especially at their tech level. Obviously their second choice was to use boats. 

Where did they get these boats? Did they conscript them from nearby towns and villages? what if there were no nearby towns and villages? Did they make one? In which case; did they have carpenters ready in their military like modern engineer crew? 

Or did they use other methods? or just did not cross at all?

TL;DR : How did military cross rivers back then, especially when pontoon bridges were not applicable?

My candidates:

- Fourth millenium BC: Kushim
Named on clay tablet from the city of Uruk, alledegedly first known name in history. But my nomination stands even if its not a name but a title, becasue it is primirily in recognition of the invention of writing, leading to things like... civilisation... history...

- Third millenium BC: Khufu / Cheops
In recognition of the capability of humanity to accomplish large scale projects of huge complexity, and thereby create ""eternal"" pieces of art and beauty.

- Second millenium BC: Hammurabi
In recognition of creation of universal norms enabling the management of ccomplex societies.

- First milllenium BC: Homeros 
Maybe shared with Thales? I definitely want to recognise the Greek revolution of thought and the rise of logos that maybe could be better represented with Thales, but Homeros is such a huge basic figure of our culture that I just cannot miss him.

- First milllenium AD: Jesus

I'm aware that academia in the humanities is defined by ""publish or perish"", and that any tenured position is exceedingly unlikely without numerous and high quality articles and books.

- The Norman Conquest

- The Crusades and various conspiracies about the Knights Templar

- The Wars of the Roses

- The Tudors, especially endless mountains of books on Henry VIII and his ridiculous number of marriages

- The 2nd World War and the Cold War

In my field, for example, which is the Early Middle Ages, I hate the over the top obsession with the Vikings to the level of people not understanding the historical and geographical context. There's so much more about the era that is not being covered, like the Merovingian and Carolingian Francia, the Anglo-Saxon England is emerging out of the Viking shadow only now, Italy might not have well existed in the Middle Ages between ancient Rome and the renaissance, the Eastern Europe only gave us Polish plumbers apparently.

67,Why are the Vikings celebrated as such great warriors??,"I can never understand this. Sure there was a lot of cool things they did and their religion is cool but I still don‚Äôt understand. Their common folk weren‚Äôt any better fighters than other realms pretty much everyone had to train for war at least in England as you could be called up for the Fyrd or levied in other places. Their success against the Anglo saxons could be attributed to weak leaders and attacking small groups but when met with an equal like Wessex they lost in the end at Ashdown and Eddington and could never break Wessex . The Danes only completely took England when they were Christians not pagan Vikings. The Norseman and Danes had a presence in Ireland but were ousted by Irish warriors extremely frequently. The only major victory in Scotland was attacking an exhausted Pictish army after they had just battled the Scots. They could never get into wales significantly as the welsh armies continually defeated them. In Paris, they were held off by 200 men at arms approximately whilst they had thousands of men. They often were paid off because they weren‚Äôt seen as a threat just an annoyance but when they fought the Franks like at Saucourt they were pretty badly defeated. All the people talk about is the Viking pagan spirit but their most impressive accomplishments were after converting to Christianity in my opinion. The legacy of the Normans taking England ,Sicily, Ireland, Wales, and even Jerusalem and the Danes creating an empire across Denmark, England, and Norway earlier is more impressive to me.

I personally think so, since scientific advancement/spread is somewhat pointless if there's no tangible consequence to it - which was perhaps the case for a lot of scientific and mathematical innovations prior to it - they didn't really have much use, did they? Eg - did Euler's identity really help for anything until post-IndRev fields like fluid dynamics/signal processing.

2,What is the consensus of General Douglas Haig in WWI? Butcher? Or he did what needed to be done to win the war?,"I am far less informed on WWI than I am WWII. I guess I found it a boring war, since I associate it with the word ""stalemate"", impressive in it's mass casualties like the 1st day of Somme, and Verdun, but boring in that they didn't have the offensive technology to break a stalemate like in WWII.

So I have not watched hours of youtube videos on WWI, even though they've been getting really popular in recent years. Perhaps a wikipedia article on General Haig. 

What is the consensus on General Haig today? In his wikipedia page, he had both defenders, and people who absolutely deride and hate the man.

One article mentioned that in some peoples views, he had outdated tactics for yesterday's wars, but the British also pioneered some of the military technology of the era, decent planes and the first tanks on the battlefield.

I know he's controversial because I found he had both defenders and detractors, but what's the verdict on him on this forum?

Edit: My impression of Haig due to popular culture, has always been General Melchett from Black Adder Goes Fourth which was made in the late 80's. Super incompetent as a general and needlessly causes massive casualties for his men in military plans that never work or accomplish anything for winning the battle tactically, or the war strategically. I can't help but feel Melchett was inspired from General Haig, and fed into the stereotype that the British WWI soldier in the British public's mind was ""Lion's lead by donkeys""",history,1514620234,SuperJew113,44,14,True,2017-12-30

I've posted on here twice in the past year, to show off the latest incarnations of my ""leader list"", my slightly dumb hobby of identifying and ranking the greatest military commanders in history. My last two posts can be found at the following links, for reference:

https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5ykj3a/the_top_100_commanders_of_history_my_list_a_long/

https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/764ned/the_300_greatest_commanders_of_history/

I said last time that I was working on a book. The book is being worked on...slowly. I've started my Master's Degree in Military History, so that takes up a lot of my time. My wife says I might be borderline autistic...which sounds about right. At about 11pm each night, she taps on my computer screen or the spine of my book and goes ""Say goodnight to General....I can't pronounce that."" Nevertheless, here it is: my best stab at the Top 300 Generals in History (and the Top 50 Admirals, and some flyboys for good measure).

In response to criticism and suggestions from all of you, I have also separated out the naval and air commanders into their own lists. It doesn't make much sense to compare Nelson with Caesar. 

Thanks to Reddit character limits, I can only include so much in this post. I think you'll find the format much improved over my last two posts, but that squeezes out my criteria from my last two posts. I will be re-posting the criteria, and another list there wasn't room for, in the comments.

For your ease, I've also included some keys so you know who's been promoted, demoted, or added since the last list two months ago (the second link.)

That‚Äôs what I have. I encourage you to Google or Wiki someone you‚Äôre not familiar with ‚Äì or just ask, I‚Äôd love to talk about it. I'm off work until the 3rd to field all your questions!

I would live to hear from anyone who has something to contribute, hate on, praise, whine about, critique. I am all about exposing this list to criticism, because criticism can only make it better. 

I'm always looking to refine, edit, and tinker with this list, and I fully admit that, like anyone, there are serious gaps in my knowledge, so I'll always be ready to listen - though I have pretty good reasons for why most of these guys are as high and low as they are, I am always ready to debate!

But what about when borders were established, farming was common and people in general had enough to eat and thrive on?

It was written about 4 months afterward, as a minute by minute recounting of what happened, who did what and how they did it.

It covers the planning, the pre attack practice landings ( in the UK ) and the  midnight drop into Normandy. The targets and the attacks and the results.  

This report was finally declassified by the Canadian Army in 1986. 40 years after the report was first written. See the declassified stamp on the cover page of the report.

If you have ever wondered how  Operation Neptune ( the parachute landing part of Overlord )  was carried out...read this. 

I was able to find this while searching for another report about the Canadian operations around Caen. The original projection was that  the city of Caen would be captured by D plus 2 days. In fact it took 31 days to do it.

I can get how authorities might use their powers to do things by proxy (start a war, profit from war; start something financially, commit insider trading or otherwise profit somehow; work in intelligence, sell drugs in South America; etc). These would be acceptable answers but preferably people that were literally caught (not those who simply *may* be guilty), and also anyone who didn't use their position in power to create the proxy (ie it is only used for the cover-up, not the creation) would get extra bonus points.",history,1513513871,AManIsBusy,10,3,True,2017-12-17

Recently, I've started reading about the history of the Roman Republic because I'm going to GM a tabletop RPG game set in ancient Rome.

I'm really enjoying studying it. And it got me curious about all those other civilizations mentioned in my sources. I ""know"" most of them by name, but have near zero knowledge about what they actually were, how they came to be, and how they were gone.

I'd like to know where can I learn, in a chronological fashion - because it makes more sense to me - about the history of human civilization, without delving in too many details about art/music/other specific things. Sure, I'd like to know superficially how all those things were back in the days, but without going too far.

It would be very cool if I could study all the civilizations that coexisted in the same period of time, even if they never heard about each other. Even better if I get maps. I love maps.

Covers a broader period of history, politics and tactics. Animations are a bit better than HC and the narration was pretty good. Originally the video creator was using his own voice but it had a weird accent so he changed it to a better one.

Gladius Et Historia

Uses Total War engine to re-create ancient battles. Visual and historical accuracy is pretty good and is narrated by a professional voice actor. Armors, weapons and formations are shown in detail an match historical sources.

ORIGINAL POST:
I was just reading an article detailing some of the more heinous atrocities, and most of them involved the Imperial Army giving orders to retreat, leave cities, etc. Instead of obeying orders it seems like the troops went into a murderous frenzy, killing rampantly, bombing and destroying. 

I‚Äôve read that many Japanese citizens &amp; soldiers had been fed propaganda essentially portraying Allied forces as borderline demonic &amp; psychotic foreigners who would commit every abuse possible if they came in contact with a Japanese person. 

Did this fuel them, or was there a sort of twisted idea of honor driving them to ‚Äògo out like badass‚Äô so to speak? I know very very little about WWII in general so maybe I‚Äôm missing some huge cultural element.

I've spent the last few months trying to read through the giant stack of books that I own but have never read, and I've finally come to a pair of history books that I bought as a teenager.

These books are:

They're written by George Sansom and were published in the 1960's.

I wanted to know if these texts are considered reliable or historically accurate. If not, I'll likely donate them in favor of getting a more accurate book on Japanese history of those eras after I finish my back-log. 

To that end, I have two questions:

* Are these books historically accurate/reliable?
* If not (or, perhaps, even if they *are*, is there a better alternative for studying those periods of Japanese history? My period of interest is primarily from 1400-1900, in case that matters.

So, this is rather specific, but I'm trying to find good reading material on relations between the ethnic divisions of African-Americans in New Orleans: the traditional African-American population that lived in the Uptown section of the city (""Uptown Blacks"" as they are often referred) and the Downtown, more middle/upper-class, educated Creoles of Color.

The general gist I've gotten is that, they didn't get along all that well, or, in the least, they were somewhat territorial. I've seen this mostly in anecdotal accounts (Jelly Roll Morton's autobiography, for example) and how it functioned in relation to certain traditions (tension between Uptown and Downtown Mahdi Gras Indian gangs), but I can't find much information as to how it worked on a day-to-day basis.

One question though - was the D-day invasion of Normandy a foregone conclusion?  I mean, was it a sure bet that the Allies would win?  

Some sources I have seen say that, due to weather or for other reasons, the initial invasion may have failed, but it could be re-mounted a year later or so and the Allies could have won in '46.  

Obviously the sacrifice of the men (on both sides) was real and the fighting was brutal - but was this invasion just a question of getting it over with?  That with superior numbers and resources, the Allies would win in the end no matter what?  Did Nazi Germany really stand any chance at all?  Even if they repelled the initial invasion, could the Allies have remounted and taken France later?  Was it even necessary to take France?  Did the success of the Allied effort really depend on this, or was Germany already defeated by June 1944?

Just trying to put the invasion of France into perspective.  Was its success really that fundamental to the war effort, and could it have indeed been stopped?

56,Boer Marksmen/ Kommandos,"Boer marksmen and the topics of the Kommandos are an interesting topic, they ranged from being seen as farmers on horseback to the ideal fighting force. Boer marksmen were grand fighters and were remarked as being some of the greatest in the 19th and 20th century. 

Background.

Boer marksmen were the backbone of the ""armies"" (it had no offical one) from the Suid Afrikaanse Repubuliek and the Oranje Vry Staat. They typically composed of small task forces that would be quick to mobilize to defend from raiders and foreign enemies. Ideas of Boer Kommandos go back to the early days of the Dutch Cape Colony. After conquering Kaap Stadt from natives they began to push outwards into the interior and consolidate their holds on their territory. How would they do this? Small militias are known as Kommandos, these units would, as mentioned before, ward of attacks from enemies. During the 1700s when Boers desired self-ruling from the VOC they embarked on a mini trek into the deep interior, As far as the south OfS for reference,  these trekking Boers needed protection from not only VOC authorities but native tribes like the Xhosa and Basotho, ergo the Kommandos. Eventually, the Napoleonic wars occurred, and the British invaded, soon Kommandos were replaced with British redcoats. This led to the great trek and so forth.


The First Boer war


After the annexation of the relatively poor Boer republic of the Suid Afrikaanse Repubuliek, Boers had grown resentful of British occupation so, in turn, they revolted. This revolt was powered by Boer commandos and was finished by the same Boer kommandos the war was a series of conflicts against 1,000 Boers and 1,700 British.Soon Boers gained the upper hand with the Capture of Pretoria and many other settlements. Soon however 2,000 extra British redcoats poured into South Africa and ready to take on  the Boer kommandos, though these kommandos were ready and struck at Majuba, this battle was fought between 500 Boer kommandos and 500 British red coats it seemed even and the British had the top of the Kop (head.) Though the Marksmanship prevailed and the Boers struck a decisive victory against the British, this led to the Suid Afrikaanse republiek to be free, but with a few minor adjustments (ie Queen of England was seen as the head of state of both the OFS and  SAR, though it was more an honorary title. 

Gold Rush and Boer War part 2 electric boogaloo.

Soon the Boers had discovered gold in their republics and became rich and a threat to Britain, this led to an influx of British migrants, they were not given the same rights as the average Boer however and were outcast as Uitlanders. Soon the British government organized a raid into the Suid Afrikaanse republiek to provoke an uitlander rebellion, this however failed due to Boer kommandos being ready to take on the larger British force. Soon the Suid Afrikaanse Republiek with the Oranje Vry Staat declared war on Britain, thus beginning the Second  Boer War.


Second Boer war begins, Kommandos modilised.


As soon as war was declared kommandos charged into the British territories of South Africa, they met with great success besieging British towns. and stranding most opposition from outnumbering the Boers. This, coupled with their marksmen ship began the war on a disastrous tone as the Bors had now besieged the economic areas of British South Africa, this would not end well for any force in the end as it spelled out higher investment in  South Africa from the British.



Second Boer war heats up 40,000 on way.

Soon the ~10,000 British soldiers who were not be-sieged in South Africa were reinforced to boost the force from 10,000 to 40,000. This outnumbered the Boers who could mobilize 30,000 at the time. Though despite numerical superiority began the black week in the  British army. Soon the Commander of the British forces split up his collomns into three different force ranging from 20,000 to 10,000 (it fit to outnumber the Boer kommandos and their relative army size.) This began with the Battle of Stromberg, it started with British soldiers moving into position only to be blasted by the Boer commandos who had hidden around the British troops and shot upon the equally sized force eliminating it from fighting again. Soon the Boers realized their disadvantage in numbers and employed the minds of skilled generals like Koos De Le Rey and Piet Cronje, soon they employed a grand strategy, create a fake trench in front of the main Boer trench, this worked to the te  when British soldiers attacked with overwhelming numbers they were defeated by the smaller force, this warded off the British force. British generals had thought the suffering was over but there was a cherry on top at the Battle of Colenso, 9,00 Boer troops decisively destroyed 20,000, this ended black week.


Aftermath.

Though these victories crippled the British the British came back with  500,000 Troops which overwhelmed the Boer marksemen. Despite the skill of Boer Marksmen the boers could not stop the horde. Capitals of the Boer republics were taken by the horde and forced the Boer marksmen to guerilla warfare.

72,Why was futuristic fiction not as prominent in earlier centuries?,"Although a few ( Still very few relative to other works ) writings throughout history existed depicting elements such as travel to the moon, satires and fictive scenarios, while in the 1800's some of the books which feature elementary sci-fi ( Note, sci-fi, rather than futurism, slight difference although the two often go hand in hand ) themes such as Frankenstein or War of the Worlds, it wouldn't really be until the 1920's and 1930's with the rise of Asimov and the like that definitive futuristic literature will begin to truly establish itself - I.E not just fictive scenarios, but an explicit vision or settings intended as a prediction of what the world will look like or the direction it will develop based on current social trends and material reality.

One might say that apocalyptic religious literature might've been the closest thing to works which try to envision the state of the world in it's future state, but due to their intention and nature ( A future based on divine revelation, rather than an imaginative exercise in extrapolating existing social and material developments ), I don't think they can be classified exactly under the same category.

Needless to say, throughout history, fantasy has been an all-time favorite for folk talkes and all manner of literature, romance has always been present, epic sagas and warrior tales count as ancient action, and so on, but the concept of futurism seems fairly absent. Remember not to conflate futuristic literature as inherently a ""sci-fi"" literature, let alone ""sci-fi"" from a modern perspective. Futuristic fiction is any story which takes place in the future where political, social or technological progress has transpired according to how the author thinks it will. ""Brave New World"" for instance is much more focused on social changes.

So an early futuristic writer might be expected, much like modern futurists usually place their novels within decades or eons away from present time, to choose a future date where his story takes place, and then, just to throw out a few examples - predict a world in which there is no more nature because castles and towns have spread over every inch of the known world. Or someone living in a war period predicting a world in which there is some global peace treaty that ended all wars ( Which would be futuristic for the time ), or a world in which an endless war has been going on and every living human has been drafted while, I don't know, the kings and their successors constantly breed ( the usual way ) new soldiers for the next decade of warring, or someone seeing the water mill in action and trying to extrapolate some purely bogus future technology from that and so on.

Essentially, there have certainly been enough things up until the 1920's to prompt a futuristic literature much as today, where ""It is the year 20xx and.."" have cropped up like mushrooms, but ""My story takes place 200 years from now..."" seemed to have been practically unheard of, even in the 1700's or 1800's. Is there any special reason for that?

95,The Top 10 Greatest English Military Defeats,"The English are proud of their military history. While it was usually the Scots, Welsh and Irish cannon fodder who did most of the bayonet work, England did succeed in fending off various Popes, the Armada, Napoleon, the Kaiser and Hitler while conquering a quarter of the world. 
True, it doesn‚Äôt hurt if your home base is an impregnably rocky island surrounded by treacherous seas, on the one hand, and, on the other, the people whose lands you‚Äôre conquering with your Maxim guns and smallpox-infected blankets are still in the bronze age. However, England‚Äôs military history is far from being an unbroken list of smashing victories. In fact, it contains some of the most shameful defeats, humiliations, routs and catastrophes outside the Stark Family Christmas Newsletter.
Here‚Äôs just a few in chronological order‚Ä¶

1. The Battle of Watling Street 61 AD
A climactic show-down between a massed alliance of English tribes under Queen Boadicea in place in Roman-occupied Britain. 230,000 woad-painted savages (according to Tacitus the historian) revolted, burned down Colchester and attacked the small garrison army under Gaius Suetonius Paulinus. Though twenty times fewer in number, the legions crushed the British, killing 80,000 and forcing upon the natives such trappings of civilisation as literacy, clothes and bathing until 410 AD.

2. The Battle of Bannockburn 1314
Seven thousand lice-ridden Scots savages unaccountably overcome the perfumed flower of English knighthood, twenty thousand in number, as it besieges Stirling Castle. The lumbering English knights fail to penetrate the schiltrons of Scottish spearmen on the first day, and are scattered the following day when King Robert of Scotland counter-attacks leading to Scottish independence for three hundred years and the passive-aggressive folk anthem ‚ÄúFlower of Scotland‚Äù played loudly whenever a Scots side comes down to Wembley to be thrashed by an under-strength English Under-13 Woman‚Äôs Team.

3. The Battle of Bordeaux, 1453.
For almost a century previously, English armies had rampaged across France at will. Ostensibly, they were there to claim the crown for a succession of English kings. In reality, they were systematically looting their neighbour‚Äôs rich provinces so the war could be run on a for-profit basis. In 1450, the French managed to re-assert control over the duchy of Aquitaine in western France. Not content to lose a valuable source of pillaging and rapine, an English force of six thousand mustered near the town of Castillon in 1453. The climax of a vast and confused battle came when the army under John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, charged what he thought was a small French force veiled by the dust of battle. In fact it was the largest collection of artillery ever assembled at that point in history, over three hundred guns. The English were shattered and the remnants cut down by victorious French cavalry. The battle resulted in the English losing all landholdings in France (except Calais) and is considered to mark their final defeat in the Hundred Years‚Äô War. 

4. The Battle of Medway 1667
An unusual sea defeat for the English at the hands of Holland, a country about the size of a pimple and made almost entirely of waxy yellow cheese. During Second Anglo-Dutch War, an enemy squadron led by Admirals de Ruyter and de Witt sailed up the Thames and set fire to the British fleet at anchor in Chatham, destroying six battleships and capturing the flagship, the Royal Charles.  Ultimately the Dutch withdrew because the battle had been so ludicrously easy, they couldn‚Äôt believe it was a cunning British trap which, of course, it wasn‚Äôt.

5. The Battle of Saratoga in September‚ÄìOctober 1777
Two British armies set off to meet up in Albany and then lay waste to Philadelphia. One of the armies, seven thousand men under General Burgoyne, chooses not to take the safer sea route via Lake Champlain but instead embarks on a forced march through wooded, hilly country. When his men reach Albany, Burgoyne finds his colleague General Howe has skipped the rendezvous and gone straight to Philadelphia. Instead, an entrenched American army of nine thousand men await him. They surround the British and force their surrender. While casualties are relatively small with the British suffering only four hundred dead, the defeat persuades France to ally with the new Republic leading to England‚Äôs eventual loss of the immensely rich American colonies.

6. The Massacre of Elphinstone's Army, January 6th - 13th 1842
Like all invasions of Afghanistan, the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839-42) started off pretty well. The British marched into the country, took the capital, Kabul, wiped out the official army and then, through lazy and corrupt administration, managed to unite the tribes against them. Lord Elphinstone was the commander of the British garrison in Kabul. He was entirely unsuited for command, even for a British general, being querulous, elderly, indecisive, weak, and utterly incompetent. In the face of growing unrest, he decided to withdraw his force, which numbered around 4500 troops, of whom 690 were British regulars and the rest Indian.  The garrison also included 12,000 civilians, including soldiers' families and camp followers. During the retreat, the force was continuously ambushed by tribesman and, in the final massacre, 15,904 killed, ninety-five were taken prisoner (including Elphinstone, he wasn‚Äôt hurt, no fear), and only one, a regimental surgeon, Dr. William Brydon managed to reach the safety of Jalalabad. 

7. The Battle of Isandlwana January 22, 1879
While invading Zululand in southern Africa, Lord Chelmsford, the elderly British commander decided to split his force of fifteen thousand men into three separate columns in order to surround the Zulu forces. Commanding the main column of five thousand regular troops and native auxiliaries, he set up camp in Isandlwana, just five miles from a Zulu army his own scouts had not detected. He then divided his force once more and marched off into the bush to leaving behind one thousand seven hundred men to guard the camp. Not long after his departure, an army of twenty thousand organised, motivated and tactically mobile Zulus attacked the position and exterminated one thousand three hundred defenders armed with the state-of-the-art Martini-Henry breech-loading rifles and two 7-pounder field guns, as well as a rocket battery. The defeat by an indigenous force wielding cowhide shields and Bronze Age spears was a humiliating blow to the premier military power of the day.

8. The Battle of Majuba Hill, February 27th, 1881
Shortly after midday one Sunday in spring, during the First Boer War, Major-General Sir George Colley and a detachment of three hundred and fifty-four men, including sixty-four sailors, marched up a barren and strategically useless hill in the Transvaal, and made camp on its summit. A numerically inferior force of Boers, white South African settlers, then surrounded Majuba Hill, and spent the rest of the day picking off the defenders with artillery until Colley and two hundred British soldiers were dead; the Boers only suffering two casualties. The fatalities were not high but because the British had so signally failed to crush the enemy, the South African Republic became a historical inevitability leading to a century of apartheid for the only people not actually involved in the battle, the native Africans.

9. The Battle of the Somme 1 July 1916-18th November 1916
The Somme Offensive was the largest battle of the First World War on the Western Front. More than one million men were wounded or killed, making it one of the bloodiest battles in human history. The battle was preceded by a seven-day bombardment featuring 1,700,000 shells, before fifty-one British divisions advanced across No Man‚Äôs Land along a fifteen-mile front of Northern France. Unfortunately, the bombardment had left the half a million German troops awaiting them largely untouched in their deep-dug trenches and done little more than churn up the mud. On the first day alone, the British suffered more than 57,000 casualties, greater than their total British casualties in the Crimean, Boer, and Korean wars. The battle lasted 141 days and by the time the offensive ended in November, the British listed around 420,000 casualties (German casualty numbers are controversial, but may be about 465,000). High-powered artillery and machine gun fire caused massive casualties for troops approaching an entrenched enemy. However, it is often forgotten that the Somme was a tactical and strategic victory for the British, though at a massive cost. The battle was fought by the British to relieve pressure on their French allies who were being hammered by the enemy at the equally bloody Battle of Verdun. The British penetrated ten miles deep into prepared German trench works while, at the same time, ensuring the French armies in the south were able to hold out. The British also employed air power and tanks for the first time, establishing new methods of warfare that enabled a final breakthrough in 1918.

10. The Fall of Singapore, 8th-15th February 1942
In the years before the Second World War, the city Singapore on the tip of Malaysia was the major military base for the entire British Empire in Asia, and nicknamed the ""Gibraltar of the East"". When war began, the combined English, Indian and Australian force was commanded by Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival who even his own biographer could not describe as the most prepossessing personality, describing him as a ""tall, bucktoothed and lightly built‚Ä¶ with a lisp"". His mistake was to scatter his forces across the islands under his command and refuse to build any defences even when a Japanese invasion was imminent; ‚Äú""Defences are bad for morale‚Äù, he said, ‚Äúfor both troops and civilians"". In the event, two divisions of well-equipped, motivated Japanese infantry, captured the city in two weeks from a British Commonwealth force three times its size. About 80,000 British, Indian and Australian troops became prisoners of war, joining 50,000 taken by the Japanese in the earlier Malayan Campaign. Winston Churchill, called the destruction of Singapore the ""worst disaster"" and ""largest capitulation"" in British military history.

96,Winston Churchill: The Case *Against*,"*Written by me as a purportedly humorous hatchet-job on Winston Churchill but never published by the people who commissioned it*

WINSTON CHURCHILL: ‚ÄúTHIS WAS THEIR FINEST DRUNK‚Äù
How England‚Äôs greatest Prime Minister set troops on the poor and cheated his way to the Nobel Prize while drunk as the lord that he was.

What can one say about Winston Churchill that has not been said before?
 British statesman, historian, orator, wit. Blah-blah-blah. Noble family, political father, heiress mother. Blah-blah. Cavalryman and journalist. Blah-blah. Reforming Chancellor of the Exchequer. Blah-blah. The wilderness years. Blah. Wartime prime minister. This was their finest blah. Nothing to offer bust blah, blah and blah. Blah-blah. An iron blah is descending across blah. Nobel Prize for blahness. Britain‚Äôs Most Famous Briton for blah years in a row. 
Everybody knows everything about Churchill. Every year, there are more documentaries, films, plays and articles churned out about the iconic buttock-faced statesman. Let‚Äôs look at some aspects of his life that they tend to miss out.

Churchill v. The Working Man
Churchill did not have much affection for the working class. In 1910 Churchill was Home Secretary when striking Welsh miners rioted in Tonypandy in the Rhondda Valley, completely overwhelming the local police. He sent in armed troops to reinforce the constables. A year later, he sent them in against strikers in Liverpool where soldiers discharged their weapons, leaving two strikers dead. In 1928, when the militancy of the nationwide General Strike threatened to overthrow parliamentary democracy, he deployed 10,000 troops to Glasgow to keep order. Even today Churchill‚Äôs name causes squeals of hate from hard-line trade unionists and their supporters; in 2013, the New Statesman, the house magazine of the British left, was producing articles like ‚ÄúShall We Hang Mr. Churchill Or Not?‚Äù

Not His Finest Hour
Churchill always fancied himself a military strategist. ‚ÄúI have it in me to be a successful soldier. I can visualize great movements and combinations‚Äù. His romantic delusion was badly dented at Gallipoli.
Early in World War One, the forty-year old First Lord of the Admiralty realised the conflict had become a horrific quagmire. He asked the Prime Minister: ‚ÄúAre there not other alternatives than sending our armies to chew barbed wire in Flanders?‚Äù. His solution was a second front; specifically, an amphibious attack on the Dardanelles, a narrow stretch of water separating Europe from Asia, a thousand miles to the south. By landing at a place called Gallipoli, an army would overwhelm Turkey (German‚Äôs ally), relieve Russia (Britain‚Äôs ally) and persuade neutral powers like Greece, Bulgaria and Rumania to join the war. ‚ÄúA good army of 50,000 and sea-power‚Äîthat is the end of the Turkish menace‚Äù, is how he pitched it the Cabinet.
The attack on Gallipoli began on the morning of February 19, 1915, with long-range bombardment of the peninsula by British and French battleships. Almost instantly, the plan failed. The landing was delayed by the hesitation of the commanders, allowing the Turks to reinforce defences and when the army did land, it could not break out the beachhead, suffering constant bombardment on the beach. After a year, the allied forces had to withdraw, leaving behind 46,000 dead.
The disaster nearly brought down the government and Churchill had to resign. For years after, the defeat compromised his career; ‚ÄúThe ghosts of Gallipoli will always rise up to damn him anew‚Äù concluded one political insider.

The Living Saint

Mahatma Gandhi is currently regarded as the father of modern India and the avatar of pacifism. Winston Churchill loathed him. A proud imperialist, he believed ""the loss of India would mark and consummate the downfall of the British Empire"" (and, of course, he was right).
When the Viceroy of India, began negotiations in 1931 with the famed Mahatma (‚Äúliving saint‚Äù), Churchill told the Council of the West Essex Unionist Association: ""It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr. Gandhi, an Inner Temple lawyer, now become a seditious fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Viceregal Palace, while he is still organizing and conducting a defiant campaign of civil disobedience, to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.""
For a long while, Churchill was regarded as Gandhi‚Äôs nemesis. In1942, when British India was threatened with invasion by the Japanese and 2,500,000 Indians had volunteered to fight for the British, he had Gandhi locked up for two years in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune as a seditious trouble-maker. To Gandhi‚Äôs own surprise, he was released in 1944. He did not know that by then Churchill had conceded independence was inevitable and considered him more pro-British than other Quit India leaders of the time.
(Historians Jad Adams and Andrew Roberts both note that during the war, Churchill also blocked the release of an Imperial Indian Police report. This contained information that Bupa (‚Äúfather‚Äù), as Gandhi was also called habitually. liked to sleep naked with child-age girls, including his grand-niece. The news would have destroyed Gandhi politically but was covered up personally by Churchill on the advice of, of all people, George Orwell).

Gasbag

When the Kurds rebelled against British rule in Iraq in the1920s under the leadership of Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji, Churchill was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúI am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against the uncivilized tribes‚Ä¶ it would spread a lively terror‚Äù. He concluded: ‚Äú""I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas‚Äù.
Except as his enemies now concede, he was not talking about the kind of poison gas used on the Western Front like mustard gas and chlorine gas but about the disabling tear gas which modern police forces still use in European cities today. (Modern historians now conclude the British did not use gas at all during the conflict but that it was Churchill‚Äôs own forceful statement that convinced observers that weapons of mass destruction were deployed).
Churchill might not have authorised the use of gas in Mesopotamia but he certainly did in Bolshevik Russia. A British expeditionary force had been sent to Arkangel. With Churchill‚Äôs authorisation, it was armed with 50,000 top secret ""M Devices"", an exploding shell containing a highly toxic gas called diphenylaminechloroarsine. The man in charge of developing it, Major General Charles Foulkes, called it ""the most effective chemical weapon ever devised"". They were first used on 27 August 1919, targeting the village of Emtsa. Bolshevik soldiers were seen fleeing in panic as the green chemical gas drifted towards them. Those caught in the cloud vomited blood, then collapsed unconscious (again, it was a non-lethal gas). The weapon was used with decreasing success in other skirmishes until, unfortunately for Churchill, it became obvious the arctic weather did not favour further usage. The remaining ‚ÄúM Devices‚Äù were dumped in the White Sea.
It was during the Second World War that Churchill‚Äôs fascination with gas came within a hairsbreadth of apocalyptic catastrophe. In the early part of the war, he initiated plants to use the lethal mustard gas, which blistered skin and melted soft tissue, against any invading force as it landed on British beaches. The order was only forestalled by British victory in the Battle of Britain. But 20,000 tonnes of the gas were stockpiled in North Wales in case of need. 
But in 1944, when it was obvious the allies were winning the war, Churchill proposed the use not just of gas against Germany but of anthrax (estimated, by his science adviser Lord Cherwell, to be 300,000 times as powerful as poison gas). He personally authorised the purchase of half-a-million anthrax bombs from the United States on March 8, 1944, and spoke happily of ‚Äúdrenching Germany in [poison] gas‚Äù. Only urgent advice by the Joint Planning Staff that, far from shortening the war, the use of chemical weapons would slow up the Allied advance, stayed Churchill‚Äôs hand.
Only after the war was it discovered that the Nazis had their own stockpiles of gas ‚Äì not old fashioned liquid-suspension gas but fast-acting, undetectable nerve gases like Sarin and Tabin, specifically for use as retaliation weapons. If Churchill had unleashed the faintest whiff of mustard gas, it‚Äôs likely Hitler have exterminated any British city within air range in an afternoon.

True Colours

Was Churchill a racist?
Of course he was. Every one of his generation was. Even the period‚Äôs most liberal and progressive politicians had some prejudice against one or other racial, ethnic or religious demographic. (Saintly activist Gandhi wouldn‚Äôt let his daughter marry a Muslim; Elizabeth Cady Stanton, suffragette, had a horror of ‚Äúdegraded black men‚Äù).
Even amongst his peers, Churchill‚Äôs racism was noteworthy. Even his startled doctor, Lord Moran, said of other races: ""Winston thinks only of the colour of their skin.""
When he was Colonial Secretary, he issued such opinions as: ""I hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion."" During a famine in Bengal in 1943, millions starved. British officials begged Churchill to redirect food supplies to areas in need but he refused blaming the population for ""breeding like rabbits"". 
After the war, as Britain‚Äôs colonies began to break away from the Empire, Churchill‚Äôs attitudes had not softened. During the savage ‚ÄúMau-Mau‚Äù uprising in Kenya, he had 150,000 of the insurgent population forced at gunpoint into detention centres. He regarded the local Kikuyu as ""brutish children"" and argued that Kenya's fertile highlands should be cleared of ‚Äúblackamoors‚Äù and be solely the preserve of white colonialists.
And don‚Äôt get him started on the Middle East. He regarded the Palestinians as 
""barbaric hordes who ate little but camel dung"" though, to be fair, being an equal opportunity hater, he also speculated in a 1937 unpublished article that Jewish people were ‚Äúresponsible for the antagonism from which they suffer‚Äù and that ""there is the feeling that the Jew is an incorrigible alien, that his first loyalty will always be towards his own race‚Äù.

Blood, Sweat &amp; Brandy

It‚Äôs sobering to remember that at key moments in British history ‚Äì the sea battles of World War One, the General Strike, the Battle of Britain, D-Day and the development of the British atom bomb ‚Äì one of the key men in charge was more likely than not to be drunk as a skunk.
‚ÄúI drink champagne at all meals, and buckets of claret and soda in between,‚Äù he boasted. He listed ‚ÄúHot baths, cold champagne, new peas and old brandy‚Äù as the four essentials of life. During the ferocious struggle with the Nazis, a royal visitor reported Winston was putting away enough champagne to ‚Äúundermine the health of any ordinary man‚Äù.
He kept his mind primed with Scotch and sodas during the long workday and relaxed after hours with his now famous Churchill martini: a glass of chilled English gin flavoured with a solemn nod toward occupied France in lieu of vermouth, which was naturally difficult to get.
His biographer attested: ‚ÄúThere is always some alcohol in his bloodstream and it reaches its peak late in the evening after he has had two or three Scotches, several glasses of Champagne, at least two brandies, and a highball.‚Äù 
His need for booze even fuelled his statecraft: While visiting King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, Churchill was informed that, being in a Muslim country, he could neither smoke nor drink during a banquet thrown in his honour. Winston blew up, informing the king that ‚ÄúMy religion prescribed as an absolute sacred ritual smoking cigars and drinking alcohol before, after and if need be during all meals and the intervals between them‚Äù.

Nobel-Winning Ghosts
In 1953, the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Winston Churchill ""for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values"".
All his life Churchill supported his political career with his journalism and then, as he became more famous, his multi-volume histories: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had any money except what my pen has brought me‚Äù, he said in 1945. Aside from hundreds of articles, he wrote forty-two books including lengthy biographies of his father Lord Randolph Churchill and his distant forebear the Duke of Marlborough; his history of the First World War, The World Crisis; his six-volume opus The Second World War; his sweeping A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, and even an early romantic novel. 
But how many of them did he actually write?
It was only recently discovered that Churchill used ghost writers for his major works, a team that became known as ‚ÄúThe Syndicate‚Äù. This was a floating team of writers which included his own son, Randolph Churchill, two retired generals, a former naval officer and an Oxford historian.
Churchill edited and rewrote what they produced but there was so much copy coming in from so many sources that obvious errors abound throughout his work: in one notorious passage, he refers to the French army as the ""poop of the life of France,"" rather than the ""prop.""
Some errors were sinister. In an article presented under his name in 1937, as persecution of Jews in Germany intensified, Churchill claimed that ‚Äúthe Jew‚Äù deserved the violence being meted out because he was ""different"". ‚ÄúHe looks different. He thinks differently‚Ä¶He refuses to be absorbed‚Ä¶Every Jewish moneylender recalls Shylock and the idea of Jews as usurers...‚Äù. Churchill had always been considered a philo-semite and pro-Zionist by historians so this article startled many until further analysis revealed that though Churchill had tried to sell the article to a number of magazines under his own name, it was in fact written by one of his ghost writers, one Adam Marshall Diston, whom he had not noticed was a fascist supporter of Oswald Mosley.
So, did Churchill deserve the Nobel Prize for Literature? One historian concludes the issue is ‚Äúalmost as superficial a question as asking a master chef, 'Did you cook the whole banquet with your own hands?'""

But I'm interested in knowing how they related to to *each other*. Since they were far closer to one another then either was to the West(even if divided by the Himalayas), I'd assume there was a much stronger interchange between the two.

&gt;High-altitude testing of the U-2 soon led to an unexpected side effect--a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). In the mid1950s, most commercial airliners flew at altitudes between 10,000 and 20,000 feet and military aircraft like the B-47s operated at altitudes below 40,000 feet. Consequently, once U-2s started flying at altitudes above 60,000 feet, air- traffic controllers began receiving increasing numbers of UFO reports.

&gt;Not only did the airline pilots report their sightings to air-traffic controllers, but they and ground-based observers also wrote letters to the Air Force unit at Wright Air Development Command in Dayton charged with investigating such phenomena. This, in turn let to the Air Forces Operation BLUE BOOK. Based at Wright-Patterson, the operation collected all reports of UFO sightings. Air Force investigators then attempted to explain such sightings by linking them to natural phenomena. BLUE BOOK investigators regularly called on the Agencies Project staff in Washington to check reported UFO sightings against U2 flight logs. This enabled investigators to eliminate the majority of UFO reports, although they could not reveal to the letter writers the true cause of the UFO sightings. U-2 and later OXCART flights accounted for more than on half of all UFO reports during the late 1950's and 1960's.

The blue book article on Wikipedia fixates on the minutiae of the program and completely misses the real source of its origins. To re-cap, the Air Force spent decades convincing the American people that the odd aerial phenomena, a surge of new classified aerospace technologies that they had being seeing, were mundane misinterpretations of common occurrences.  The most famous of these was the classic ""swamp gas"" explanation which fostered a deep mistrust among the citizenry and spawned the rise of the the UFO coverup conspiracy theory.

By the windy shores o Canada bay I broke my fast for Lucia's day, 

A beguiling figure she blew my way &amp; rattled me rovin' heart, 

The snipers crack, the metronome of pricy heels on polished stone, 

That I were soon to call my own by way o' the ancient art. 

I were cozened by a whiff-o-the-whim that scours the Costa harryin', 

The likes o' men who've lost the lamp, the rudderless and bewildered,

The sands below are littered wi' bones o' those who've taken a belly o' stones,

And turned their backs on wives &amp; homes to follow the black Matilda.

Ho-ro m'lovelies cross yer hearts &amp; hope to die,

If e'er ye're drawn beneath a murky fathom of her eye,

Ho-ro my lovelies kiss yer arse a fond goodbye,

Ye'll never again be able to lift yer head so bloody high.

For even the boys of Inverary know, from Tortuga to Jericho,

She took three hundred souls below off the deck o' the Andalusia,

The poets and the Sages tried to warn us down the ages,

Their blood drips from the pages where they tell o' the Black Matilda.

She pursed her lips &amp; spun a tune as fine as any silk cocoon,

That's ever left McEacherns loom &amp; held me there in a tawper,

A bastard I was born y'ken? I lived as tho' I'd never end,

I'll die a disenchanted man, they'll bury me as a pauper,

For men have drowned &amp; men have swung, the brig at Iron Cove were hung,

Wi' a garland of the old, the young, all battered &amp; unfamiliar,

Theres no poetry theres no tune, no point in howlin' at the moon,

A caution to ye very soon ye'll waltz yer Black Matilda.

By the windy shores O' Canada bay I blew my friggin brains away,

Its not as tho' i'm proud to say, its not as tho I coulda killed her,

I'm off to Hells begotten shores where men like me have sailed before,

And they shall sail forever more in the name o' the Black Matilda.

Ho-Ro m'lovelies cross yer hearts &amp; hope to die,

Its enough to make ye cry, enough to make ye cry!

the situation is as follows;

you have a democratic technologically developed country next to a less advanced country, and the latter is being somewhat colonized by the former.
they are both the size of cities btw and they are very close together.
i would like the colonized country to rise against the colonizers without destroying the country and get the colonizer to reform (rather than independence, the colonized want to participate in the democracy and have equal rights)

so i want to know if there are any similar examples, and if not, i would like to know how they would go about changing the government? in a monarchy situations i imagine you can kill the king/queen and their line, maybe in dictatorships you can take the dictator and his close allies down, but how do you do it for a democracy especially in a city sized community

Two of the classes are Knight and Prince, each of which are considered ""Noble"".

I have it that the land is 1d6 acres in size, but after seeing an areal shot of 160 acres, I realized I should probably scale that up if I want it to be realistic.

So my question is this: What size should a landed knight's domain be?

P.S. I'm drawing on a medieval European setting (because tropes are easy), but I have quite a few references to Rome in the form of various weapons and items. Also, there are four races which are entirely cosmetic, but I might make the prince class (an ""elite"" class that is hard to get at character creation) unobtainable by one of the races for flavor reasons.

Essentially, the US had set the ship on a secret mission to deliver part for the first atomic bomb (Little Boy) to the AFB from where it would be dropped on Hiroshima. After concluding the mission, the ship was torpedoed, and suffered the single greatest loss of life at sea in US Navy history. Of the 1196 men on board, ~300 went down with the ship, leaving nearly 900 in the water. Even though a distress signal had been sent out no response had been sent in reply. As for the men, they suffereded immensely for four days, facing dehydration, seawater poisoning, and shark attacks. Of the nearly 900 who went into the water, only 317 would survive. Survivors' stories are truly harrowing.

This feels like a real life example of a ""curse""- after delivering something as deadly and world shaking as the first atomic bomb, the crew suffered the worst loss of life at sea in the US Navy's history, and in the most horrific way.

Are there any more examples of things like this throughout history- well documented events where exceptionally horrific things happened to anyone who was involved with a certain item/place/etc (e.g. the first atomic bomb)?",history,1509816479,KloppLivesMatter,11,2,True,2017-11-04

46,Historical Track Records?,"*First of all, By track record I mean length and degree of World Dominance and Achievements by a Nation state/Monarchy

This is a question that I *know* is endlessly discussed, so sorry for bringing it up again . I want to get some opinions on this because I see many, *many* posts about it, but none of the answers are usually comprehensive, in the sense that the don't take all factors/achievements into consideration. Also I'd like to say that one war/confrontation is not demonstrative of a Nation's prowess and certainly not it's endurance, one factor that I think may reflect the most on a country's ""greatness"".

Personally, I honestly don't know, but I would have to put the Germany and Russia up there. Germany because of their irrefutable skill in bouncing back from major catastrophes and obvious supremacy over most other European nations at the turn of the 19th century. World War One is a showcase of this. Europe started this war with the illusion of the old system of 5 powers. By the halfway point, Germany had propped up both of their allies, by providing the Ottomans with an entire high command (almost), Crushing the Serbians where Austria couldn't, and saving Austria from the Italian Offensive and stabilizing a line there. A year later they forced Russia out of the war. And all of this while holding back  the British, French, and Belgians in Northern France. (and I'm not ignorant of the other side of things, but I'm trying to paint a picture ;) )

Russia because of their performance in the Napoleonic wars and World War Two. I included the Napoleonic wars because that marked the point that established Russia as the ""Gendarme of Europe"". And in World War Two because of their slugging match with Germany, and (let's not forget!!!) various Eastern European countries. In my opinion, Russia in WW2 is the pinnacle of the idea of manpower over technology. But of course you can make the argument that Operation Barbarossa was just another Grand Armee to fall victim to General Winter. And you wouldn't be wrong. The main reason why I chose Russia is their sheer ability to take that idea so far. The fact that they fought a ruinous war and then pivoted into a standoff with the most powerful nation on earth is just crazy. The fact that Russia was actually *ahead* in the cold war in (arguably) the first decades, that they didn't fall behind despite a massive handicap in the beginning is admirable. But, of course, that principle was proven lesser. So it's still very much an open-ended question.


Another reason why I made this is because no one else talks about the massive difference in innovation and production between the Industrial Era and the Medieval and back. I think it's ridiculous to say that because England, say, was only the most powerful for a century, and China was the ""most powerful"" for millennia, that China ""did better"". (for example) England was the most powerful (imo) during the second most innovative century in the history of our species, the 19th. The amount of factors that were introduced during that century and the next that would affect any countries standing is huge. Not to mention that the Han dynasty, say, in the 1st Century wouldn't and couldn't have done anything to affect, say, Rome's standing. What I mean is that you can't *really* compare empires that were thousands of miles apart like you can today, since the only thing that would affect them would be internal or completely different external circumstances. We have no examples of anything like Rome or Alexander the Great going head-to-head with a favorite pick like China (obviously).

Hi guys! I'm looking for an idea for a screenplay and I thought about this interesting true story.


If I remember right what happened was the ship's captain knew there was land in the fog but it was too dangerous to send the big boat closer. Instead he sent a smaller boat with a dozen men or so to inspect the shoreline. The boat disappeared in the fog and after a few hours hadn't returned. He decided to send a second boat to find the first one. After a day neither boat had returned and the main ship was forced to leave without them. I was thinking this would make an awesome beginning to a horror movie.


I thought it was Vitus Bering but after looking through the Wiki pages related to him the story doesn't come up. I also scoured the James Cook pages to no avail. Does anyone recollect this story and know who it might be?

66,What was infantry referred to by in antiquity/ancient times?,"I did a bit of searching around and found that the term ""infantry"" didn't start getting used to describe foot soldiers until the 1500's and, individually wasn't officially widely used until the British did so in the 1800's. So from this I gather the term ""Infantrymen"" is a modern term.

Being based off the Latin word ""infans"" or referring to ones youth, foolishness or stupidity some would argue that's the reason for using the word to describe the most laborious, simple, and violent military position. 

Another possibility is that ancient armies were structured according to family wealth and seniority. Richer, aristocratic men could afford the best armor and weapons, while the younger, poorer, men would be limited in the equipment and thus used as the component to bear the brunt of the fighting. 

So why would later civilizations come to use this word to call their most crucial soldiers? It seems a little counter intuitive to me. Maybe they knew that the general public wouldn't have a clue as to what ""infantry"" actually meant?

89,American counterculture in the 1980s - looking for recommendations,"I tried /r/AskHistorians already and didn't get much of a response, so I'm trying again here.

I've noticed an interesting paradox when it comes to American cultural history: when we think of American counterculture, there's a lot of focus on the 1950s through 70s (from beatniks to disco), whereas the '80s are depicted as the ""death"" of counterculture under the Age of Reagan.

At the same time, the '80s are portrayed as being about hair metal, John Hughes, arcades, and Rubik's cubes. But I know there was the first rumblings of college radio and alternative rock in the form of Husker Du and Talking Heads, subversive films by auteurs like David Lynch and Spike Lee, and Reagan was not as universally loved as he might seem in retrospect. This counterculture is what eventually culminated in grunge and '90s mainstream culture. It's just that this seems to be a neglected topic when it comes to the retelling of the 1980s. Are there any good books out there about this?

Are there any good books/documentaries/websites/webinars out there about American counterculture (history, politics, creative works, etc.) in the 1980s?

**TL;DR: I'm looking for articles or books that talk about the political climate of Berlin during WWI, and the Weimar period.** Quite broad, introductory texts would be good! And if anyone happens to have any PDFs, or knows of where I can access these texts online, that would be fab. If not, I have access to a good library here, so it's fine.

I'm in my third year of university, studying History of Art - more specifically, this semester, I'm studying Dada and Surrealism. I'm currently working on an essay discussing the differing attitudes towards Expressionism conveyed by the Zurich and Berlin Dada groups, respectively. As part of this essay, I'd like to touch on how Berlin art tended to be more overtly politicised, since Zurich was in neutral territory during WWI, whereas Berlin was more involved, and political.

I think that follows quite logically, but I do need some sources for this essay that talk about how and to what extent Berlin was affected by the war. I'm not awfully familiar with German history (hence why I'm only just touching on this subject in my essay; I'll put greater emphasis on the philosophical and artistic differences between the movements), so I don't mind if the texts are quite introductory and broad.

With so many states barring released felons from voting for life, how to they stay within that provision? Are they considered ""okay to do so"" because the provision was never enforced? 

Have there been any lawsuits challenging this practice?

Thank you for any information or links related to the topic in response!

(From Wikipedia:)
Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) later superseded Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 and explicitly repealed the compromise. It provides that ""representatives shall be apportioned ... counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed."" A later provision of the same clause reduced the Congressional representation of states who denied the right to vote to adult male citizens, but this provision was never effectively enforced.

57,How 1971 India-Pakistan War almost started World War 3,"Background:

Before 1971, Bangladesh used to be a part of Pakistan as East Pakistan. According to Najam Sethi, a well respected and honoured journalist from Pakistan, East Pakistan always complained that they received less development funds and less attention from the West Pakistan (Punjabi) dominating government. Bengalis in East Pakistan also resisted the adoption of Urdu as the state language. The revenue from export, whether it was from the Cotton of West Pakistan or Jute of East Pakistan, was handled mainly by West Pakistan. Lastly, in an election conducted just some months before the war, the victory was gained by the East Pakistani leader and still he was not given the power, thus fueling the movement in East Pakistan.

Pakistani army started its operation in East Pakistan to contain the movement and anger among the Bengalis. It is reported that the army was involved in mass killing of public and mass rape of women. India was aware of this and was only waiting for a trigger to start the war. India started receiving huge number of refugees which became unmanageable, pushing it to intervene in the situation. The situation soon attracted the attention of many other countries. Thus the war later was not only between India and Pakistan, but many countries were involved in 1971 Indo Pakistani war (War of Liberation of Bangladesh) directly or indirectly.

In May, Indira Gandhi wrote to Nixon about the ‚Äòcarnage in East Bengal‚Äô and the flood of refugees, burdening India. After L K Jha (then the Indian ambassador to US) had warned Kissinger that India might have to send back some of the refugees as guerrillas, Nixon commented, ‚ÄòBy God, we will cut off economic aid [to India].‚Äô

A few days later, when the US president said ‚Äòthe goddamn Indians‚Äô were preparing for another war, Kissinger retorted ‚Äòthey are the most aggressive goddamn people around.

US and China Connection, A Little Known Fact (All Excerpts and Sources from 929 page long Volume XI of the Foreign Relations of the United States)

US sympathized with Pakistan, because of various reasons. Among them two reasons were that: firstly, Pakistan belonged to American led military Pact, CENTO and SEATO; secondly, US believed any victory of India will be considered as the expansion of Soviet influence in the parts gained by India with the victory, as it was believed to be a pro Soviet nation, even though they were non aligned.

In a telegram sent (famously know as the Blood Telegram) to US Secretary of State Will Roger, on March 28, 1971, the staff of the US consulate in Dhaka complained, ‚ÄòOur government has failed to denounce the suppression of democracy. Our government has failed to denounce atrocities. Our government has failed to take forceful measures to protect its citizens while at the same time bending over backwards to placate the West Pakistan dominated government‚Ä¶ We, as professional public servants express our dissent with current policy and fervently hope that our true and lasting interests here can be defined and our policies redirected in order to salvage our nation‚Äôs position as a moral leader of the free world.‚Äô

This brought China in the picture. US needed help from China and the messenger was Pakistan. US approached China very secretly on this issue, who was more than welcoming as it believed that their relations with US could improve from this onward.

During the second week of July, 1971, Kissinger arrived in Beijing, where he heard the words by then Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai: ‚ÄúIn our opinion, if India continues on its present course in disregard of world opinion, it will continue to go on recklessly. We, however, support the stand of Pakistan. This is known to the world. If they [the Indians] are bent on provoking such a situation, then we cannot sit idly by.‚Äô On this, Kissinger responded that China should know that the US also backs Pakistan on this issue.

Indira Gandhi, the Indian prime minister in those times decided to tour most of the Western capitals to prove Indian stand and gain support and sympathy for the Bengalis of East Pakistan. On November 4th and 5th she met Nixon in Washington. Nixon straight forwardly told her that a new war in the subcontinent was out of the question.

The next day, Nixon and Kissinger assessed the situation. Kissinger told Nixon: ‚ÄòThe Indians are bastards anyway. They are plotting a war.‚Äô

The pressure increased in East Pakistan, which attracted Indian attention. Indians were preparing for war and were concentrated on the Eastern front. To divert the pressure, on December 3, in the dark of night, even before India could attack East Pakistan, Pakistan opened western front and air raided six Indian Airfields in Kashmir and Punjab.

The CIA reported to the US President that Indian Prime Minister believes that the Chinese will never intervene militarily in North India, and thus, any action from China would be a surprise for India and Indian military might collapse in tensed situation caused by fighting in three different fronts (East, North and West).

Hearing this, on December 9, Nixon decided to send the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal to threaten India. The plan was to Surround India from all four sides and force them to retreat and leave East Pakistan.

On December 10, Nixon instructed Kissinger to ask the Chinese to move some troops toward the Indian frontier. ‚ÄòThreaten to move forces or move them, Henry, that‚Äôs what they must do now.‚Äô China feared any action on India might attract Soviet aggression. At this, US assured China that any action taken by Soviet Union will be countered by US to protect China.

Britain and Soviet Confrontation Confidential ‚Äì The Commander of the Military Intelligence Service Gen. Pyotr Ivashutin.

‚ÄúThe Soviet Intelligence has reported that the English operative connection has come nearer to territorial India, water led by an aircraft carrier ‚ÄúEagle‚Äù [On December 10]. For helping friendly India, Soviet government has directed a group of ships under the command of admiral V. Kruglyakov.‚Äù

Vladimir Kruglyakov, the former (1970-1975) Commander of the 10th Operative Battle Group (Pacific Fleet) remembers:

‚ÄúI was ordered by the Chief Commander to track the British Navy‚Äôs advancement, I positioned our battleships in the Bay of Bengal and watched for the British carrier ‚ÄúEagle‚Äù.

But Soviet Union didn‚Äôt have enough force to resist if they encountered the British Carrier. Therefore, to support the existing Soviet fleet in the Bay of Bengal, Soviet cruisers, destroyers and nuclear submarines, equipped with anti ship missiles, were sent from Vladivostok.

In reaction English Navy retreated and went South to Madagascar.

Soon the news of American carrier Enterprise and USS Tripoli‚Äôs advancement towards Indian water came.

V. Kruglyakov ‚Äú I had obtained the order from the commander-in-chief not to allow the advancement of the American fleet to the military bases of India‚Äù

In an interview to a Russian TV programme after his retirement, Admiral Kruglyakov, who commanded the Pacific Fleet from 1970 to 1975, recalled that Moscow ordered the Russian ships to prevent the Americans and British from getting closer to ‚ÄúIndian military objects‚Äù. The genial Kruglyakov added: ‚ÄúThe Chief Commander‚Äôs order was that our submarines should surface when the Americans appear. It was done to demonstrate to them that we had nuclear submarines in the Indian Ocean. So when our subs surfaced, they recognised us. In the way of the American Navy stood the Soviet cruisers, destroyers and atomic submarines equipped with anti-ship missiles. We encircled them and trained our missiles at the Enterprise. We blocked them and did not allow them to close in on Karachi, Chittagong or Dhaka.""

The Soviet ships had small range rockets (only upto 300 KM). Therefore, to hold the opponent under the range, commanders ran risks of going as near to the enemy as possible.

‚ÄúThe Chief Commander had ordered me to lift the submarines and bring them to the surface so that it can be pictured by the American spy satellites or can be seen by the American Navy!‚Äô It was done to demonstrate, that we had all the needed things in Indian Ocean, including the nuclear submarines. I had lifted them, and they recognized it. Then, we intercepted the American communication. The commander of the Carrier Battle Group was then the counter-admiral Dimon Gordon. He sent the report to the 7th American Fleet Commander: ‚ÄòSir, we are too late. There are Russian nuclear submarines here, and a big collection of battleships‚Äô.

Americans returned and couldn‚Äôt do anything. Soviet Union had also threatened China that, if they ever opened a front against India on its border, they will receive a tough response from North.

The war ended with the surrender of Pakistani army as they missed American help due to quick Russians who blocked both America and China from preventing India to advance. With this, a new country named Bangladesh was formed, which was recognized by the whole world and by Pakistan in the following year with Shimla Agreement.

So it happens that I know next to nothing about Nixon except for Watergate and even that was only touched shortly in school.

I heard the line ""I am not a crook"" before but didn't knew where it came from. After seeing it on Reddit yesterday I decided to lool it up and found out that it was a quote from Nixon which caused for major controversies and which was mocked multiple times in many shows and alike. On time I even read that it was a big part of his downfall.

What I don't find anywhere is WHY this quote is so problematic. Google tells me that a crook is something like a criminal or lawbreaker, so what is the problem with ""I am not a criminal""? 

Was it only the problem that politicians are viewed as criminals by most anyway?

Like I said: I know next to nothing about Nixon, so that is likely why I don't get.

* *The Art of Travel* also by Francis Galton
* *This Business of Exploring* by Roy Chapman Andrews

These kinds of books seem hard to find, as they aren't as exciting of a read as the result of expeditions, but rather as a precursor. Any suggestions to more of these types of books?

57,Who were some of the most brilliant policymakers?,"I've seen and heard discussions and arguments about who the brilliant military and political strategists of history were, but I've never come across a discussion about brilliant policymakers of history. So I'm asking now - who in history was an exceptionally good policymaker?

Let me clarify what I mean. Brilliant strategists (of military and political institutions) are those who were skilled at implementing strategies. In other words, given a task, a strategist's role is/was to figure out the best way to achieve that task. Usually, the task in either political or military situations is to be victorious over the opposition.

In many ways, policymakers can be viewed as strategists who have goals that are more varied than obtaining victory or power. For example, a policymaker could have had the goal of improving highway infrastructure on the Eastern coast of the U.S.A. in the 1970's. (this is just a clarifying example, no idea of the historical plausibility).

In some ways though, the role of a policymaker and what they do is very different from strategists.Whereas strategists are usually focused on accomplishing a particular task, some policymakers primary purpose is to figure out what tasks should be pursued. In doing so they are faced with an unimaginably vast realm of possible paths from which they must choose.

Anyone is free to argue what the signs or qualities of a brilliant policymaker are. Here are some of my opinions as to what is the bare minimum for a good policymaker:

1) a large proportion of their policies were successful in the larger context of the policymakers goals. (you might have very good aim, but very few would say that you are successful if you very accurately shot yourself in the foot. also, very few would say you were brilliant at what you do if you have one or two brilliant successes, but also many abject failures)

2) their policies were actually implemented. (it's hard to determine how effective policies which were not implemented would have been, and in general better to avoid this type of discussion/conjecture)

For a brilliant policymaker I would also add these as possible guidelines:

3) their policies had a historically significant impact.

4) Furthermore, the policymakers success was due to skill. There is evidence to suggest that the policymaker had a very good understanding of the important aspects of whatever problem they were trying to fix.

5) Bonus points if the policymaker had to overcome obstacles or prevailing forces in society in order to achieve their goals. 

Edit: Removed : (e.g. successfully implementing policies which undermine or go against the wishes of those in power is impressive). from 5

Reading the comments, it's clear that I didn't effectively communicate what I was looking for.  I'm not looking for a list of people who were were effective at getting their policies implemented. I'd consider that to be political efficacy, demonstrating sound political strategy. I'm looking for people whose implemented policies (disregarding policies which weren't implemented makes discussion more concrete) were effective, well-written, well-implemented, etc.  
I totally botched the last sentence of 5. I meant that implementing policies which face obstacles/have little public support in a way which minimizes friction, or properly accounts for that opposition in a clever way is impressive. It's also important to know when a policy is not worthwhile to pursue due to overwhelming opposition.

I'm not sure if it's rude/bad rediquette to edit/rephrase post that's already been up, if so let me know. It might just be better to leave it be once it's started to generate comments.",history,1508035689,redditor_0607,12,5,True,2017-10-14

62,Why did Mao's China not achieve superpower status like Stalin's Russia?,"They both ruled their countries for close to 30 years, and both countries were laid to waste by either Germans or Japanese invaders. But Stalin is notable for transforming what was once an eastern European backwater into a superpower that rivaled the United States in economic and military power. The same cannot be said for Mao's China. Its economy did grow, but its population grew just as fast making the gains moot. It's per capita wealth miserably low, far lower than Russia's or America's and even worse than many African countries.
So while it may be true that China is becoming a potential superpower now, how come it took so much longer than it took for Russia?

Edit, to those who misinterpret what I mean by ""superpower status""
I don't mean superpower in the sense of playing war games and dominating the world, I mean in terms of economic or industrial strength. I don't argue that China isn't industrialized now, they make very high quality products. I know they don't make junk, they make iPhones and iPads for one thing and are economically a superpower basically. but it took it much longer than it took the Soviet Union, and from 1949 to 1976 remained hopelessly poor and undeveloped, until after Mao died and Deng Xiaoping took over.

In other words, from about 1978 to 2008, they became developed and prosperous enough to host the Olympics. But from 1949 to 1978, nearly 30 years as well, it remained one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world, perhaps even poorer than India at the time.",history,1508039818,d4t4sh,428,2635,True,2017-10-14

Second: Regarding the reformation in England and the succession of Henry VIII, what were the laws of succession back then?  How was it that Mary succeeded Edward VI and Elizabeth succeeded Mary?  Were both Mary and Elizabeth made legitimate when Henry passed?  

Lastly: If Mary was so concerned with England falling back into a break with Rome, why did she let Elizabeth succeed her?  Why not name a different successor (if that was even legal)?  Alternatively, why not just have Elizabeth popped off if she cared that greatly about her religious cause?

It was not until Pompey the Great had delivered Tigran's son whom had tried to betray his father to usurp his throne did Tigran the Great dissolve the mighty empire he had built, ruling Armenia as an ally to the Romans till his death.

70,"To what extent were the classical religions, belied systems and mythologies of early civilisations interconnected through a possible prehistoric common point of origin?","Right, so from what I've observed and what I've read in a book on Indian history by John Keay, there seems to be quite a few parallels between Vedic mythology, Greek mythology and early Judeo-Christian tradition. For example, there is a distinct similarity between the Vedic flood legend of Manu and the Great Flood featuring Noah. To scrutinise further, even China has a similar flood myth set around the same time concerning Yu and the founding of the Xia Dynasty. Another example is the similarity of some of the Greek and Hindu gods. Now I'm not saying they're the same, but on some level both the Indo-Aryans and the Greeks, and to some extent, many other societies, have assigned similar roles to some of their gods; there is always a harvest god, a god of war, a god of hunting, a god of fertility and so on. The thing about religions is that they don't just pop up instantaneously, they are always built upon a litany of earlier tradition. For example, a group of burgeoning agriculturalists in say √áatalh√∂y√ºk may draw upon earlier animalistic beliefs that their hunter-gatherer ancestors adhered to and summarily alter them to fit their concurrent settled lifestyle (eg the necessity for a deity in charge of the harvest or fertility etc.). So what I'm saying is, drawing upon the context of big history, would it be possible that all the early religious traditions or belief systems could have had a similar origin? After all, we humans did constitute one big group back in Africa 200,000 years ago before a few groups of us migrated outwards and further diverged and dispersed across the face of the Earth. It's because of this spatial dispersal that we have a divergence in the cultural and linguistic propensities of various human groups as humans tend to be nurtured differently when subject to different environments and climates.

74,A Review of The Latest Lars Anderson Archery Video,"Greetings R/History! Lars Andersen, the noted archery fraud, has released another video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8dBQVDROdA

As it contains numerous inaccuracies, I thought I should address them. I should state that, first and foremost, I am not an archer and nor do I have any experience with archery, either as a sport or in terms of reenactment. For this reason I shall examine his claims from an academic and historical perspective by utilizing various primary and secondary sources that clearly contradict his assertions. My imaginary drink shall be a bottle of Woodford Reserve Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey, so let us begin!

0.05: The narrator says that Lars Andersen is trying to reinvent historical archery. There are two problems with this. The first is that archery was employed across the world, which each individual culture maintaining their own unique methods and approaches . Thus there was no single style to reinvent. Secondly, many traditional forms such as Mongolian and Japanese archery still exist, so there are still plenty of practices that have not been lost and require no reinvention to begin with. DRINK!

0.13: The narrator is referring to movie depictions of archery as if they are proper sources that competitive bowmen, reenactors and historians rely on. If Lars Andersen want to critique popular images of archery, he is welcome to do so, but such representations have nothing to do with archery as it is studied and practiced. DRINK!

1.12: The narrator says an archer must be able to shoot and move rapidly. This is complete and utter nonsense because they are assuming there was only one style of archery, and one type of archer, and that they existed in an unchanging form throughout history. The standing regiments of the Persian Achaemenid Empire employed archers in a static formation behind shield walls:
""the Persians had made a palisade of their wicker-work shields and were discharging their arrows in great multitude and without sparing,‚ÄîPausanias, seeing that the Spartans were hard pressed and that the offerings did not prove favourable, fixed his gaze upon the temple of Hera of the Plataians and called upon the goddess to help, praying that they might by no means be cheated of their hope""

Artwork of Assyrian archers also show them standing behind a shield-bearer, meaning jumping about like a caffeine-infused squirrel was not their preferred method of shooting:

http://biblelandpictures.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2435-3-Assyrian-archers.jpg

It is also useful two note that the two archers in the image are drawing the bow at the same time, indicating that volley shooting may have indeed been used, although they would have not been held at a draw as that would have been too tiring.

Moving onwards to Roman history, Anna Komnena describes the following formation designed by the Emperior Alexios Komnenos:
""Having noticed this from long experience the Emperor arranged his lines and phalanxes in such a way that the Turks should shoot from the right side, the side on which the shields were advanced, and that our men should shoot from the left, the side on which the Turks‚Äô bodies were unprotected.""

The reference to lines and phalanxes makes it clear that it was an ordered formation, and that the archers would thereby be shooting from a stationary position.

Enguerrand de Monstrelet, writing in the 15th century AD, describes the English archers as being both stationary (one does not plant stakes into the ground if one planes to cavort) and shooting as a mass volley:

""The rest of the English remained with king Henry, and were shortly after drawn up in battle array by sir Thomas Erpingham, a knight grown grey with age and honour, who placed the archers in front, and the men-at-arms behind them. He then formed two wings of men-at-arms and archers, and posted the horses with the baggage in the rear. Each archer planted before himself a stake sharpened at both ends. ""

and

""Their archers, amounting to at least thirteen thousand, let off a shower of arrows with all their might, and as high as possible, so as not to lose their effect"". 

Similarly, speed of shooting was not always preferred. The Roman writer, Vegetius, described the training of archers:

""A third or fourth of the youngest and fittest soldiers should also be exercised at the post with bows and arrows made for that purpose only. The masters for this branch must be chosen with care and must apply themselves diligently to teach the men to hold the bow in a proper position, to bend it with strength, to keep the left hand steady. to draw the right with skill, to direct both the attention and the eye to the object, and to take their aim with equal certainty either on foot or on horseback. But this is not to be acquired without great application, nor to be retained without daily exercise and practice.""

Strength and accuracy is clearly emphasized as opposed to letting loose as many arrows as possible.

DRINK!

1.16: The video is showing a page from the Strategikon of Maurice to support the assertion archers always shot rapidly. This ignores that methods of archery were different depending on the culture and time period. DRINK!

1.20: The narrator claims that, as we know from tribal warfare and historical texts that an archer who stands still and shoots slowly is useless. So useless they were used in a stationary fashion for thousands of years. DRINK!

1.24: The narrator says fast-shooting is the only way to get past a shield, whilst showing people getting hit by arrows whilst carrying ahistorical shields. A Roman scutum from the Republican era:

http://www.roman-reenactor.com/wpimages/wp949aa6da_05_06.jpg

Could protect a wielder completely from a bowman, no matter how fast they shoot.

DRINK!

1.37: The narrator states historical archers would train on moving targets whilst in motion themselves. From which culture and which era? Anna Komena writes:

""The Emperor arrived in Thessalonica, as already stated, and there prepared for Bohemund‚Äôs crossing by training the recruits in stretching the bow and shooting arrows at a mark"".

This is a clear reference to 'historical' Byzantine archers shooting at a non-moving target. Artwork such as this image from the 14th century Luttrell Psalter:

http://www.historic-uk.com/assets/Images/luttrellarchery.jpg?1430303998

Also show archers taking aim at a stationary target whilst not comporting themselves in the manner of gymnasts. It was horse archers who would train whilst in motion.
DRINK!

1.44: The narrator says archers never used the well-known round target with separation lines. Except for the CLEAR ROUND TARGET WITH SEPARATION LINES FROM THE LUTTRELL PSALTER! DRINK!

2.09: The narrator claims that historical bows consisted only of string and bow, and nothing else. This is an immensely gross simplification. Historical bows could be constructed of multiple materials, with various design elements such as siyahs and laths. Bow cases were also important, they could protect the bow from humid conditions which could cause it to weaken. DRINK!

2.12: The narrator seems to think modern sport archery and ancient and medieval war archery were the same thing. DRINK!

3.14: Now the narrator is stating how advantagous trick-shooting was in battle. I have an image now of a Persian archer somersaulting through the ranks at Thermopylae and killing Leonidas with a curving arrow in slow-motion.

3.31: Congratulations Lars, you shot the horse. A pity it was wearing armor and just trampled you and crushed your skull. Alternatively, the horse kept on going because the single arrow was not enough to kill it and the rider just put a lance into your throat.

3.84: Okay guys, you heard it here first. Everything in an ancient myth can be taken literally!

4.05: Hitting an arrow in flight is not really useful when there are several thousand more coming at you. Battlefield conditions were completely different from trick-shooting. DRINK!

The point of my question is, what are some examples of World History in which one side strongly believed in its cause, while the rest of the world viewed it vastly opposite. 

Obviously we have North Korea, but I feel like that's a little different because of the level of deception the Kim Dynasty has impressed upon its people (i.e. complete, or extreme, restriction and manipulation of information) but, considering WW2 German didn't have Google and Daily Mail, maybe it can be. Now I'm just thinking with my thumbs.

2,"Until the 20th century Medicine was harmful. Thoughts on ""Bad Medicine: Doctors Doing Harm Since Hippocrates""","The book ""Bad Medicine""  released through Oxford University press is a fascinating look at a profoundly troubling reality.   From the time of Hippocrates two millennia ago,  the institution of healing served to increase death and injury through a tradition of violent treatments such as slicing open veins, cauterization,  and the use of potent vegetable and mineral poisons such as opium and mercury.  Thus the common ""history of progress"" associated with medicine is a delusion - even as the scientific revolution overthrew religious tyranny and great leaps were made in biological knowledge, the medical profession used each development to support the traditional vitality reducing responses to disease. 

The 3 primary arguments of the book are 1)  Medicine for millennia injured rather than healed.  This is true based on modern knowledge - we can state unequivocally that widespread bloodletting (a noteworthy example)for illness increased the odds of infection and death.  2)  A failure to ever seriously use data to support dogma was a primary enabling factor.  Furthermore data that was developed which might have advanced the healing profession away from superstition was overwhelmed by collective faith.   3)  The pre bacterial knowledge system emphasized the patient as opposed to the disease in determining treatment, and was thus doomed to stagnation and failure due to an inability to recognize causation. 

The authors rationalizations for this absurd and horrifying reality is, succinctly,  that medical tradition was justified dogmatically via the same mechanisms as religion.   A monopoly on ""true knowledge"" was granted by nations across the world to medical men, they were afforded legal financial and social protections,  and endowed with false prestige via universities, licenses, and ecclesiastical support.  The placebo effect and the power of imagination, under these conditions,  we're enough ""evidence"" to enable a system of methodically multiplying the damage of diseases to persist and thrive behind a benevolent mask.  Doctors,  patients, 
and society generally were thus all hoodwinked into participation in the systemic injuring of the diseased. Over time the momentum of conformity and ultimately the real influence of medical institutions in society cemented all this,  only to be ""corrected"" as toxicology and statistical analysis became unignorable due to advances made a century and a half ago, effectively disintegrating a two millennia tradition of superstitious ritual sacrifice, and allowing theories to rise which enabled medicine to actually benefit and extend human life. 

In this light it is fascinating to consider the impact of epidemics throughout time,  and the catastrophic tragedy of medicine in accomplishing the exact opposite of its goal for thousands of years.   Perhaps the most astonishing implication of the text is the capacity of institutionalized superstitions to dominate consensus even when the falsehood injures the faithful.  I highly recommend the text for a good dose of iconoclastic insight that tends to get swept under the rug.",history,1506754651,InfraggableKrunk69,6,0,True,2017-09-30

19,English upper class,"Reading books and watching movies about 18th, 19th century England, a lot of the characters are the upper class wealthy families that are not royalty. The yearly income of individuals are often mentioned for example for marriages and so on. They own mansions and employ more people just inside the house then most companies do now.

However, these wealthy families are never shown as having any type of jobs or businesses. They just hang around the mansions, courting their future wife, attending dances and parties, hunting, horseback riding and so on.

Question is where did their income come from? If it was inherentance how possibly it did not run out maintaining a mansion, paying all those employed and living the lavish lifestyle. If they had businesses, what kind? Who was running it? How come they did not have to be somewhat physically involved? ",history,1506776228,powerofz,5,3,True,2017-09-30

Or for private citizens, I suppose a distinction needs to be made between public opinion and state opinion. MLK was hated by the state but loved by some of society, though both have largely come around in his favor.

16,How important were generals during ancient/medieval battle?,"So I have recently been reading a semi-historical account of Qin‚Äôs wars of unification in ancient China and in one of the battles the general of one army is slain with the battle still in the balance (itself something that‚Äôs probably incredibly rare) and as a result of that his entire army essentially collapses despite the rest of the officer corp still being around.  

Now my question concerns how likely such a scenario actually is. Was the highest-ranking military commander really that important *during* a battle that had already started? I mean, sure, troop placements and such are without a doubt important but was there role after that so central that without them things would soon go badly no matter the other circumstances?  

I always figured that once shit hit the fan and the melee broke out there wasn‚Äôt much in the way of orders that could be given to the units that had already engaged the enemy anyway. Maybe the cavalry, reserves and such could still be directed but from my understanding once things had started the meaningful options available to a commander were pretty limited and the ‚Äúmomentum‚Äù of the battle superseded whatever tactics one might want to employ after the fact.

20,One of the top videos on YouTube about the HRE is unrepresentative and even wrong.,"I have a young cousin who is into history, and she told me about a cool video she found on the Holy Roman Empire that she thought was interesting and so I had her send it to me. I finished watching it a few minutes ago, and it is BAD. The reason I am posting this here is because the video has **700K views and mostly likes**, which is worrying. Most of the watchers seem to be teenagers who are into history, and the maker straight out talks nonsense for almost six minutes - which is absolutely infuriating.

The video in question is titled ""[Why The Holy Roman Empire Was The WEIRDEST Country Ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev8f5CMc4gM&amp;t)"", already off to a bad start, calling the HRE a country and a nation. The author beings by quoting Voltaire, whose famous comment was about the state of the HRE close to it's end. He then proceeds to objectively refer to the HRE as dumb, and once again weird.

I wrote down some key wrong/misrepresentative claims from the video: 

1). The HRE was founded to ""represent Rome"", as apparently opposed to protect the papacy and spread Christianity in Europe.

2). The author says that Austria, Bavaria, Prussia/Brandenburg and the Netherlands started in the Empire but were ""obviously their own independent countries"", ignoring 900 years of Empire history before the pre-modern era.

3). The Imperial Diet is weird. So is the elective monarchy, which apparently ""defeats the purpose of a monarchy"". The system was also apparently corrupt because the Habsburgs kept winning, ignoring the need for existing Imperial infrastructure, army and wealth. And once again, the Habsburg ruled many ""countries"". They were elected because ""it was a bad idea to make them mad"".

4). The Hasburg Emperors were able to declare a war on their subjects apparently as the dukes of Austria, but no as emperors - ignoring that, just as examples, the crusades against Bohemia and the Schmalkaldic war were fought as the emperor due to breaches of Imperial law. Once again, ""stupid and a headache to historians"".

5). The Emperor couldn't command the king of Prussia due to the peace of Westphalia, not due to the king of Prussia being immensely powerful apparently.

6). The empire stopped being holy during the reformation, ignoring the incredibly central part Christianity and protection of Christianity in Imperial law and constitution.

7). Napoleon ended the HRE because ""the whole thing was stupid"".  The empire is once again dumb and being hardly ""anything it claimed to be"".

I am sure it is possible to find plenty more in the video, but I needed to vent. This video and channel, claiming to be educational, are super popular with an audience that clearly believes that the author is knowledgeable. Yet anyone who read even a tiny bit on the Empire can recognize this bullshit from a kilometer away.

It infuriates me that people who might be interested in history are misled by this sham of a video.

32,Why Western Rome fell but not Eastern Rome? (Was multiculturalism the problem?),"I've read about this theory why Western Rome fell but not Eastern Rome. This theory is that Western rome was ""barbarized"". Barbarians would become generals and gain supporters and in general just infiltrate the society. They were given citizenship but their true allegiance was not towards Rome but towards their own people and tribes. As long as the romans paid them and it was peaceful and stable in the roman society the barbarians and other ethnic groups were fine. But things changed when the economy went downhill and the empire was destabilized. Now all the different ethnic groups and barbarians only cared for them self and their well being, not Rome and eventually Western rome collapsed. 

Now here is my question. If this was the case why did not Eastern rome collapse? Did they not have as many barbarians and ethnic groups in their country?",history,1506185231,bitman_,19,0,True,2017-09-23

When Caesar went on long campaigns (or really any commander back then I would be curious about, earlier or later too) was part of his entourage artists to take note of the culture (maybe even famous  soldiers who took up history/art after the war?)?  or are all of the images/statues/drawing we see made much later, and completely by artists who had never been there to see it?  

for example, ""Dying Gaul"", has the sword and the neck torc that help us to recognize him as a Gaul.   but what about the mustache, the hair style, the facial features, body size?  are those just based on Roman features, with the sword and neck torc being the only ""Gaulish"" characteristics?  Obviously, genetic traits are passed down and what we see today of their descendants can give us a rough idea, but since so many were wiped out, I guess I was thinking maybe distinctive traits were also that could have been captured by artists at the time.

Was there ever a point when Egypt was militarily undisputed in the Known World?

Edit 1: Alot of you are asking about the so called ""known world,"" which, according to some of you, is a non-existent concept. *Ecumene* which translates to, known world, was a Greek term that was used in accordance to which lands was considered habitable by the Greeks. It later evolved to encompass the Roman Empire as a whole and evolved further to embody Christendom. Modern Historians have used it to encompass the influence of European institutions and culture even to the present day. [Source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumene)

Clearly, I was not transparent in my usage of the term and so I apologize. The way in which I used it was meant to encompass the lands of the Near East, or, what was known to be ""habitable,"" to the Egyptians. A clearer picture may be found [here](https://etc.usf.edu/maps/pages/3600/3605/3605.gif) which is a 2nd Century BCE rendition by Herodotus.

I'm mainly talking about the religious practices in Islam. A religion that requires its believers to wash their hands, feet and face before prayer (al-wu·∏ç≈´), which is five times a day; and further requires a full bath after sexual intercourse or some other cases for both men and women (ghusl). My first question is that, these rituals were inscribed in the Quran, but I wonder if the common Muslim folk in the Middle East regularly practised these. Did they have the means and the piety to practise these rituals that often?

If the answer to this question is a yes; as far as I know, hygiene practices were not much common during the Medieval Europe among the common people. Did this difference in the overall hygiene level between the cultures and regions have any significant effect on the frequency of the infectious and pandemic diseases that occurred? I would love to read a paper that focuses on this if it exists.

The obvious justification is that the Soviets returned Empire's of Japan colony, Manchuria, to China and took what they lost in 1905 as a reward. Therefore it was an anti imperialist war.
Another justifications the Soviets used: the Japanese were only waiting for a suitable moment to attack USSR, espionage, aiding Germans, obstacles against Soviet shipping.

Clever leadership by German dukes and careful planning led to the Prussian's unification of the North German Federation, and their military might would crush the ex-Osterreich and Holy Roman Emperor time and time again, leading to the weakened South German Federation joining with the North, with Prussian leadership, and their unification of Germany led to the Kaiser's Reich, a German nation led by all Germans, though with reverence for the Prussians. Yet, when they are pummeled in a World War and both revolution and hope for a rekindling of the Prussian flame led to the horribly perverse Third Reich, which had it's own ideology squashed WITH Prussian Militarism once the Allies achieved victory. Why was Prussian Militarism seen as bad, yet American Imperialism is still prevalent to this day, and nations like France have their own legion of volunteers, the French Foreign Legion, seen with reverence?

I want to learn about the events of the Vietnam war but it looks like many of the books on it are either fiction or journalism, which I am fine with journalism but I want to get to something like ""Dispatches"" after I learn the basic events.  I don't know enough about the basic events to understand what the journalists would be saying.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a good book or website that would help me learn about the war either from the ""War"" aspect of it or that ""Political"" aspect?

It would also be nice if people did have recommendations for novels on the Vietnam War like Dispatches for when I finish some studying.

Stewie explains that this dimension is not in the future at all, rather it is current day. The reasoning behind all this advancement is because Christianity was never established, thus making the dark ages of scientific repression never happen. 

My question to you is, how early on did our ancestors start believing in a higher power? How much of this faith has caused a limit on our evolutionary ladder?

Like many oif you, I was facinated by Alwyn Collinson's project to live tweet the WW2 in real time for 6 years. Sadly, I only discovered it towards the end of 1943 meaning that I missed a large chunk.

Well, the project ended on August 23rd with Japanese surrender and [it closed with a suprise announcement](https://twitter.com/RealTimeWWII/status/897927643814739969). After only a a short break, the project was to restart from 1939 all over again!

In addition, to allow me to follow along more easily I've opened an automated subreddit where every tweet is automatically posted. I had no intention of promoting it, but given that the whole project is restarting it seems like a perfect opportunity to allow us to build a bit of a community.

If you're not a big twitter user but find this interesting, please join me and follow along at r/RealTimeWW2.

71,Looking for an Autobiography of a German Soldier [WW2] [Help!],"Hey all, 
Sorry if this doesn't strictly fit into the guidelines of the sub-reddit etc. but I am hopelessly desperate. 
I am looking for an Autobiography of a Wehrmacht soldier in WW2 that I read some years ago but cannot remember the name of the text or the author, but I do clearly remember a few key points if anyone can possibly put 2 and 2 together and help me out. 

1. The book follows the soldier from his childhood years in Germany, including the sexual frustrations of his teenage years and him making a girl pregnant who happened to be under 18 years old. This later causes complications as she gets taken away from him - discovering this when he later returns on leave.

2. It goes into him serving in Stalingrad, where I can remember some distinct events. He observed a German commanding officer getting shot by German soldiers who didn't want to charge into a Soviet line. He was apart of a unit that fended off a Russian charge of monumental scale supported by PaK's in Stalingrad. He had to escape after his unit was obliterated with his best friend, where he found an Opel Blitz but couldn't drive a manual so he floored it in first gear without realising his friend had been killed in the seat next to him. He is later wounded and sent home which is why he isn't captured in the encirclement. 

3. He is wounded at least twice in the war, with the last time he had to go to an SS  hospital where he recounted the comparative opulence of SS hospitals to Wehrmacht ones. This was deep in Germany and there is a point where the hospital is strafed by American P-47 thunderbolts, killing a friend he had made and eventually overrun by U.S. forces. 

4. Once he is captured by U.S. soldiers he witnesses first hand their atrocities [Both German and U.S.]. Jews from a nearby camp identify SS soldiers who are then thrown from a cliff edge to their deaths [He survives for he is a Wehrmacht soldier]. The remaining soldiers are kept in a circle and are given 1 single loaf of bread a day between &gt;25-50 soldiers. The U.S. soldiers also shoot at Red Cross members to prevent them from helping the P.O.W's. 

I'm sorry if this isn't enough, but hopefully someone can identify anything, the last two points are clearest in my mind for they were very striking and not what I expected. If there are ANY questions, please ask I am very invested in finding this book.

As a final note, I remember the blurb stressing he was an average German soldier, not highly decorated and not highly promoted. I believe he never made it higher than the equivalent of Private, but perhaps he got to Corporal, but I don't distinctively remember this particular soldier in command of anyone else. 

Thanks all.

His name was John Robinson, I have no idea what rank he was or what he did on the ship. All I know is that he had a bad time, lost almost all of his friends, and he hated talking about it.

So my question is, in the several hundred years of interactions between Native Americans and Europeans did any natives actually make it to Europe out of their own free will and become mildly successful at something that they couldn't necessarily do in the Americas? Like did any of the Native Alaskans ever make it to Russia? I understand that at the time (16-19th century) natives probably wouldn't have been treated that well in Europe but that being said I would still expect some examples of some natives going to Europe out of interest and having some occupation that they probably couldn't have had in their native lands.

79,A bunch questions about the Imperial Roman army.,"Hi, /r/history !

So I'm working on writing a story heavily centered around a contubernium somewhere in the middle of Hadrian's rule. Let's say 136 AD/CE for now.

So, first off, stupid question that I'm sure I could find the answer to on my own, but I just wanted to get it verified by people who actually know what they're talking about. What's the plural form of contubernium?

Next, I understand that the contubernium was the smallest unit, but just how small? I've seen a lot of conflicting sources. What I've seen so far is as follows:

 *Eight men
 *Eight men plus one mule
 *Eight men plus two servants
 *Eight men plus two auxiliary soldiers
  *Ten men

Also, I believe that I've read that when a legion was on a march, one contubernium was how wide the column was. Is that true?

Next up, did or did not each legion have an attached unit of ballistarii? In one place, I read that it did, and in the other that legions rarely had their own artillery.

What was the training process like to become a legionary? How were you recruited, what was the actual training like, how long did it last, how were your legion, cohort, century, and contubernium that you would be joining chosen, etc.

After that, what were standard sizes for units in battle? I mean, as in one formation. An entire legion pressed together in a testudo doesn't seem very feasible, but neither does a single contubernium. Did it just depend on the battle?

How were centuries and... uh... more than one contubernium named or numbered? Were they at all?

How were (I forget the actual name) horn blowers distributed? One per cohort, one per century, or what?

Lastly, did Rome have any kind of, I don't know, stealth units, I guess? I've heard about frumentarii, but I think those are more like spies than what I'm trying to find.

39,I Asked my Grandfather about his experience in German occupied Netherlands in World War II. I was amazed at all that happened to him and his family.,"For some reason asking my Grandfather about his experiences during World War II never really crossed my mind. I am a History/Political Science major in university and the World Wars always fascinated me so when i saw him recently I decided to ask him. Some of his stories were really amazing. 

My Grandfather was 10 years old and living in the Netherlands during World War II. His older brother was enlisted in the war and was taken as a PoW only three years into the war. His other brother was arrested at a check stop and placed into a work camp. My Grandfather recalled when the Germans first took control of Holland they bombed Rotterdam as a show of power to try and stop any thoughts of rebellion. My Grandfather lived in a farm near Rotterdam and he recalled hearing the explosions and seeing the city burn and smell the smoke in the air for days. 

My Grandfather's family owned a grain farm. In one of the silos they built a false bottom and under it they hid Jewish refugees. As the German army still needed food their farm was one of the few places that was not cut off of electricity. Because of this they were able to run electricity down below the silo so that the refugees could have light. When the Germans would come to inspect the farm or search for Jews my Grandfather would run to the edge of the silo and pee against the wall. As he was peeing he would talk down a small hole and tell the refugees the Germans were there. 

After Holland was occupied the Germans placed explosives on the underside of of bridges so that in case of an invasion they could cover their retreat. My Grandfather was tasked with finding out where the fuse wires went so that in case of an invasion they could cut these cords and help the allied army. My Grandfather was chosen to do this as a 12 year old boy is much less suspicious than an adult going around bridge. He was also often tasked with hiding fake passports and stolen food stamps at check stops as the soldiers were less likely to search children. 

I always knew that my Grandfather lived in Holland during the German occupation but i didn't know at all to the extent that they were involved in hiding Jews or any kind of underground resistance movement. It made World War II much more real to me knowing my own Grandfather had lived through it. 

If you have parents, grandparents, great grandparents anyone you know who has lived through events such as a world war ask them about it! I'm sure many of them would be more than happy to share their experiences and sadly most of the generation that lived through these events have already passed on.

50,Questions about The Battle of the Somme,"Hi r/history, I wanted to get a balanced view on the leaderships decisions regarding the first few days of the Somme.  I was reading about the Battle of Somme and listening to programs which describe the circumstances of the situation.  As I understood it, the artillery barrages before hand did not do much to clear a path for troops advancing the first day.
  
Was aircraft spotting not an option to see the path was not clear?   
  
Were the rounds used by the artillery ineffective to clear obstacles? From Blueprint to Armageddon, it was stated that shrapnel rounds were used.  Logistically, did leadership think this would be effective, and what led to that conclusion? And if so, why didn't the allies use another type?   
  
Would it have been worse to not continue the push during the second day? What I mean is, why not try to clear the path using different rounds?
  
Would the result have been the same either way?  

Obviously there are many factors, and I'd like to understand them!

51,How much better were heavily armoured knights (in different time periods 1200s-1700s) in combat versus the standard levies that were the majority of armies?,"TLDR: Could someone explain how effective martial prowess/training, mindset, and equipment would be in combat for Feudal Warrior Elites (i.e:Knights and Warrior Orders, possibly Freeholders)? Could 5 Knights beat 100 poorly armed and trained/unarmoured Levies in melee? Would appreciate it distinguished between Dismounted and Mounted

I'm fascinated with learning about the difference between a Warrior Elite and the standard soldier that would make up the majority of an army. We always focus on the Knight and the Spartan, but what about the 95% of the army that were mercenaries and conscripted peasants? Versus a knight, how effective was the common grumbling, hard-bitten soldier in the rank, rarely awarded, plagued by marching and drill, motivated by a dour sense of duty rather than a lust for glory?

I understand that the time periods are going to differ significantly, though I'm interested in comparing 1200s Feudal Warrior Elite vs 1600s Feudal Warrior Elite.

I'm starting to learn about the Crusades (Third) and looking at the numbers, they would often have a garrison 4-20 Knights with a garrison of 5-20 times that. So the ratio could be higher than 1:20 in battle let's say. 

How much did equipment factor into combat efficacy? Would a dismounted Knight in full plate be immune to most peasant/ freeholder melee weapons? I also read that many longbowmen couldn't pierce plate armour, it was more the disruption from killing horses and hitting the less armoured areas as well as the concussion. 

Would clubs/ blunt weapon be the best low-tier weapons a peasant could use to kill a heavily armoured knight (concussion through the armour?) 

Crossbows seemed to be key in defense on most sieges, were the Knights more useful/skilled with these or would the basic Soldier levies be of nearly equal ranged capability?

I could also imagine that quality of steel in weapons would be significant, would a Knight's sword basically break lower-quality weapons during a hack and slash contest?

62,Tiger Traps and Tribesmen,"Now this story is difficult to tell simply because my Grandad was around 19 at the time and as of telling me is 89 years old so he cannot remember exact details.

However from what he can remember he was fighting in the Jungle and him and his squad were tasked with searching ahead of the group for the next place to set up camp where the Japs were not. During one of there scouting ops they were ambushed and they lost 7 men leaving my Grandad and 3 others so they decided to head back to base.

On the way however my Grandad fell into a tiger trap and ended up breaking his ankle from the fall. The 3 remaining men carried on back to camp to get help.

After being in the hole with no food or water for some time my grandad saw a snake in the pit with him which he killed and ate raw. Later he heard voices but he couldn't understand the language so he grabbed his gun and waited. When they approached they were members of a small tribe living in the jungle and they helped him out from the hole and let him go on his way back to base. 

Half way there he found a standard issue English rifle so he took it and carried on back just before arriving he met the rescue party and they brought him the rest of the way. When he returned he found that the rifle belonged to one of the 3 men who had died from blood loss on the way back.

My Grandad said he remembers this the best because it was the most interesting but sad 4 days of his time serving. Also later the group would meet up with the same tribe and they would provide a place for them to set up camp. 

I'm sorry that I couldn't give you all the information on where it took place but I don't know anything about history and he cannot remember. Maybe one of you might have an idea.

I'm looking for some war documentaries to watch, but most of the documentaries I've found are too ""entertain the lowest common denominator,"" ""educate the illiterate masses,"" or ""our nation is the greatest"" for me.  What are some really good, highly accurate, highly detailed war documentaries?  I'm interested in any period up to the end of the Second World War.  Specifically:

1. I'm interested in the decisions made at all levels, tactical, operational, and strategic.  I love to understand the information available to the actors and the reasons for certain decisions.  

2. I like numbers, statistics, charts, and maps.  

3. I don't care about people.  I have no interested in the political stuff, the ""main characters"" in the story, or the heroism/emotional aspect.  

4. Apocryphal/exaggerated stories give me a brain aneurysm.  I'm a lonely, pedantic, and irritable man, I have no patience for anything other than the literal truth.

&gt; ‚ÄúGoing to marry her? Impossible! You mean a part of her; he could not marry her all himself. It would be a case, not of bigamy but trigamy; there is enough of her to furnish wives for the whole parish. One man marry her! - it is monstrous! You might people a colony with her; or give an assembly with her; or perhaps take your morning's walk round her, always provided there were frequent resting places, and you were in rude health. I once was rash enough to try walking round her before breakfast, but only got half way and gave it up exhausted. Or you might read the Riot Act and disperse her; in short, you might do anything but marry her!‚Äù 

Makes me chuckle everytime that I read it. Especially considering he's a Reverend and is supposed to be very serious about these things.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x18HOi5oF-g

 I would also like to provide a shout-out to the ever elegant u/Claidheamh_Righ for suggesting this series, although I don't know if his motivation was either trust in my ability to point out the errors, or sadism. Since the Varangians came from Russia/Scandinavia, my imaginary glass shall be filled with Br√§nnvin. So lets begin!

0.09: The first references to the Dark Ages. Drink!

0.19: The narrator states that the Varangian Guard were an elite special forces. Ignoring the redundancy of the phrase ""elite special forces"", this comparison is incredibly flawed. Special forces are incredibly small units intended for operations such as sabotage, assassinations and counter-insurgency/terrorism. The Varangian Guard were a professional unit made up of several thousand warriors that fought in pitched battles such as Dyrrhachium and Beroia. They were the equivalent of Marines who could actually shut up about being in the Marines. DRINK!

0.26: The narrator states the Varangians conquered unruly territories across the Byzantine Empire. I almost don't know where to begin with this. If the territories were across the Byzantine Empire, they didn't really need to be conquered. Additionally, the Varangians were always part of a larger army which practised a combined-arms doctrine. There was never a single instance where the Varangians alone conquered a territory. They were only decisive in the Byzantine Civil War of 989 AD where they helped the Emperor Basil ""The Amateur Optometrist"" II defeat Bardas Phocas. DRINK!

0.37: The narrator explains that Harald Hardrada helped secure the Varangian's place in history. No, I'm pretty sure being an elite guard unit of one of the longest reigning empires that ever existed did that. DRINK!

0.40: The academic called the prototypical Viking of the era. Considering that Harold lived in the 11th century AD, and Vikings had been active more than 200 years earlier, I think their definition of ""prototypical"" might be a bit inaccurate. DRINK!

0.45: The narrator just said Harold Hardrada would develop tactics that would transform warfare across the Mediterranean. Excuse me a moment.
   
SOUNDS OF OBJECTS BEING BROKEN, MASSES OF PEOPLE SCREAMING AND POLICE SIRENS
   
Okay, now I feel better. Anyway, Harold transformed absolutely nothing. He, and the Vikings/Russians/Varangians in general had zero to teach the Byzantines. The Byzantines could perform false retreats and encircling and out-flanking manoeuvres, integrated light missile troops and heavy infantry troops into a formation called the foulkon which could provide both ranged support and a solid battle-line to resist infantry and cavalry assaults, had marching formations that could keep an army together whilst being harassed by mounted archers and were incredibly adept at sieges. They had one of the most well developed military forces in the world at this point. This mistakes requires at least four shots. DRINK! DRINK! DRINK! DRINK! Oh, to hell with it. DRINK!

0.51: The academic stated that storming a city wall was usually doomed to failure. Given the number of successful sieges the Byzantines engaged in, I am not sure ""usually doomed to failure"" is the right word to utilise. Antioch, Laodicea, Candia, Kastamon, Tarsus, Preslav and a host of other cities and forts fell to them. DRINK!

0.58: The narrator states Harold Hardradas string of victories would show the Varangian Guard to be one of the most exceptional special forces of all times. Again, the Varangians were not special forces, and although Harold Hardrada became the commander of the Varangian Guard, it was just one part of a larger army. DRINK!

1.00: I honestly think this has been the most number errors I have ever observed in under one minute. Also, my liver just jumped out of my torso whilst wearing a bowler hat and carrying a pair of suitcases and proceeded to walk out the room.

1.54: The narrator just called the Emperor Basil II the most powerful man in the world. Now, as much as I love the Byzantines, I have to disagree with that. Given the population and income of Song China, one could posit that the Song Emperors or their chancellors had more power (Wang Anshi says 'hi'). Also, the Chalukya dynasty and the other Indian powers could be said to be equal in strength. DRINK!

2.36: I just love how Vladimir the Great walks in like a total pimp and looks at the princess like ""How YOU doin?""

2.43: Vladimir the Great gives a smile that says ""Heeeeeey, sweet honey-mama!""

2.46: The academic calls Vladimir the prototypical viking. THAT WORD DOES NOT MEAN WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS! DRINK!

3.04: The academic says Vladimir had 800 concubines, dozens of wives and engaged in human sacrifices. He also states there was nothing redeeming about him. I politely beg to differ. ALL HAIL THE GRAND PRINCE OF SWAGGER!

3.05: Being serious for a moment, according the Russian Primary Chronicle, after marrying Anna:

""Hereupon Vladimir took the princess and Anastasius and the priests of Kherson, together with the relics of St. Clement and of Phoebus his disciple, and selected also sacred vessels and images for the service. In Kherson he thus founded a church on the mound which had been heaped up in the midst of the city with the earth removed from his embankment; this church is standing at the present day. Vladimir also found and appropriated two bronze statues and four bronze horses, which now stand behind the Church of the Holy Virgin, and which the ignorant think are made of marble. As a wedding present for the princess, he gave Kherson over to the Greeks again, and then departed for Kiev.""

And that:

""Thereafter Vladimir sent heralds throughout the whole city to proclaim that if any inhabitant, rich or poor, did not betake himself to the river, he would risk the prince's displeasure. When the people heard these words, they wept for joy, and exclaimed in their enthusiasm, ""If this were not good, the prince and his boyars would not have accepted it."" On the morrow the prince went forth to the Dnepr with the priests of the princess and those from Kherson, and a countless multitude assembled. They all went into the water: some stood up to their necks, others to their breasts, the younger near the bank, some of them holding children in their arms, while the adults waded farther out. The priests stood by and offered prayers. There was joy in heaven and upon earth to behold so many souls saved.""

Now, Vladimir seemed to embrace his new religion wholeheartedly and went to great efforts to spread it amongst the Rus. This missionary activity hardly gels with the idea of a man without redeeming qualities and would certainly meet the medieval conception of a morally just and upright Ruler. Vladimir was an incredibly fascinating character.

3.22: Okay, I have to give the documentary credit here. The Varangians are using equipment which generally match the time period and would have realistically been a part of their arsenal.

3.26. Aaaaaaand now they've spoilt it. The narrator calls the Varangians the finest special forces in late antiquity. THIS WAS NOT LATE ANTIQUITY. Late antiquity covers the time period from the 3rd century to the 8th century AD. The Varangians were active from the very late 10th century AD onwards, or 200+ years after late antiquity. DRINK!

4.12: Vikings or members of a German heavy metal band?

4.16: The academic states the Vikings would stop at nothing to slaughter their opponents. This is completely false. True, the Vikings engaged in behaviour that horrified Christian Europeans, but they were also very pragmatic and would often prefer to accept silver and other valuable goods in exchange for leaving a region. This was much less risky and more profitable than constantly engaging in battle against native forces. DRINK!

5.15: The academic says the Varangian long-axe was more like a meat cleaver. That is true except for size, balance, design, fighting style and EVERYTHING F#CKING ELSE! This is what a long-axe may have looked like:

http://www.coldsteel-uk.com/store/viking-axe-89va.jpg
The blade was quite thin to make the weapon very light and agile. Hardly a ""meat-cleaver"". DRINK!

5.30: The academic calls the long-axe a lethal weapon. As opposed to the non-lethal weapons the Vikings were famous for using.

6.10: I must reluctantly compliment this documentary for actually discussing how important spears were rather than just focusing on swords as the ultimate tool of destruction. DRINK BECAUSE I AM TOASTING THEM IN PRAISE!

6.27: Realistic demonstration of how two people could actually fight together using a single shield for cover, unlike certain other shows. DRINK BECAUSE I AM TOASTING THEM IN PRAISE!

6.42: Accurate explanation as to the purpose of the wings on a spear. DRINK BECAUSE I AM TOASTING THEM IN PRAISE!

7.12: VARANGIANS BEING BROS!

7.40: The narrator calls Basil II the wealthiest man in the world whilst the ignoring the other major states of the time period. DRINK!

8.59: The narrator claims that in the 11th century the magnificence of Constantinople was without equal. I'm sure Kaifeng or Baghdad would be quite comparable. DRINK!

9.56: The academic says that the Byzantine Empire was legendary for its devious plotting. CULTURAL STEREOTYPING! BYZANTIPHOBIA!

12.38: The academic states acid was used by the Byzantines to blind prisoners. I cannot find any references to his being so. DRINK!

13.08: Torture or college hazing?

13.34: I never thought images of strip bars and sleazy music would ever be used in a documentary about medieval warfare before.

14.00: The academic states that Constantinople was in a lush tropical climate. Just....no. It was a Mediterranean climate, which could be very hot but also absolutely freezing in the winter. Tropical climates have an average temperature of at least 18 degrees C and are much more humid. BAD WEATHER ZONE DRINK!

15.41: Obviously blunt sword. DRINK!

15.55: The Byzantine officer is much too pale. As an inhabitant of the Mediterranean region, he would be olive-skinned or tanned. DRINK!

16.03: The narrator states the Varangians, unlike other Vikings, had to learn discipline. Whilst the Vikings may not have been disciplined in the sense of using a proper marching technique or maintaining their kit (BOOT, WHY IS THERE DUST ON YOUR SHIELD! HIT THE FLOOR AND PUSH UNTIL THE JARL GETS TIRED!), they had enough expertise to build field fortification, maintain close formations on the battlefield and were rarely caught by surprise, all which is a far cry from the image of 'wild' barbarians. DRINK!

16.05: Obviously blunt sword-point. DRINK!

16.14: Hollywood back-scabbard. DRINK!

16.18: The narrator says the Vikings were used to charging head-first into battle, which is why they were never associated with defensive tactics like the shieldwall. DRINK!

16.24: Another blunt sword-point. DRINK!

16.54: Okay, I love this combat sequence.

17.12: Hollywood dual-wield. DRINK!

17.14: The academic states the Varangians would never give ground. Except they did precisely that. At the Battle of Dyrrhachium they were drawn out from the main battle-line, isolated and routed. DRINK!

18.21: The narrator describes a tactic unique to the Vikings called the Boar-Snout. Of course, by unique they mean ""used by everyone else"". It was a common Roman, Greek and Germanic method of attack which involved assuming a wedge formation. DRINK!

19.02: The effect of this tactic looks less like ""bloody melee"" and more like ""Faster guys, the Sailor Moon Booth is this way!"".

3,A documentary review of Deadliest Warrior: Attila the Hun vs Alexander the Great,"Greetings Everyone. Today I shall examine Deadliest Warrior Season 2, Epsiode 3: Attila the Hun versus Alexander the Great:

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x511mvj

I have an imaginary bottle of Glen Grant single malt whiskey, so let us begin!

0.14: HOLLYWOOD COMBAT SPIN! DRINK!

0.23: The Persian troops are holding their violin shields in the wrong way. They have them horizontal, which means they lose any possible protection to their lower and upper bodies. A second mistake is that Achaemenid infantry used large round or crescent shields by in the 4th century BC, and had not employed those of a violin shape for over a hundred years. DRINK! DRINK!

1.24: The initial introduction of the two warriors takes place. I find that the decision to match them against one another is not sensible. Alexander is fighting as a heavy cavalryman, and Attila is a horse-archer. Such troops used very different tactics and were not comparable at all.

1.32: The narrator describes Attila as ""The notorious raider who ransacked Europe. His murderous missions forever linking his name with cruelty"". Now, one does not become a powerful warlord by comporting like a fluffy puppy, but the Roman historian Jordanes noted that Attila was ""restrained in action, mighty in counsel, gracious to suppliants and lenient to those who were once received into his protection"". Attila was an individual of complex motives, so reducing him to a caricature driven by plunder and blood-lust is imposing a false narrative. DRINK!

1.45: More anachronistic Persian shields. DRINK!

2.41: The handles on that Persian shield are made of plastic, and the techniques of manufacturing this material had been lost with the departure of the Annunaki in 1827 BC. DRINK!

2.58: The first Attila the Hun expert is Robert Borsos. He is an individual who actively practices horse archery, so I will give DW a point for that. Nonetheless, he does not appear to possess the necessary academic background. I must take a shot even though I have immense respect for his skills. DRINK!

3.22: The next is Sean Pennington, who is lauded as being adept with the dagger and spear. There is nothing about this guy on IMDB besides references to two b-grade actors. Nor is there anything showing up in a google search related to ancient history. DRINK!

3.22: Another reference to the ""cruelty"" of Attila. By what standards? Hunnic society? Roman society? Or modern sensibilities projected backwards? DRINK!

4.47: The initial expert on Alexander the Great is Peter Van Rossum. He appears to be a reenactor focusing on the Roman Empire, and this is the extent of his expertise. DRINK!

5.05: The second is 'bladed combat specialist' Kendall Wells. He has an extensive resume on IMDB as an actor, stuntman and writer without any background in history. DRINK!

5.21: The narrator asserts Alexander was from Greece, completely ignoring his Slavic heritage.

5.54: Inaccurate Persian shields. DRINK!

6.15: One of the 'experts' states Alexander the Great was responsible for killing more people than any other conqueror before his time? So more than the Assyrians? Highly doubtful, as Alexander aimed on ruling a coherent and stable empire, and only engaged in massacre against highly recalcitrant tribes in Central Asia. DRINK!

6.50: The ballista, a perfect weapon for a one-on-one duel. ""Attila, could you stand there for half an hour while I get the trajectory for this thing?""

8.36: ""Dude, I used a siege machine to hit a non-moving target after several shots!"". ""Awesome-dacious, brospeh!""

9.33: ""Just how lethal is the ballista's flying bolt?"". Well, based on the dummy who had his head completely impaled by a large piece of wood......

11.46: So the counter to a ballista is an.....axe?

11.48: So the exact type of axe they are using is the Scythian axe, or the sagaris. Oooooooone slight problem. The weapon was only used about 900 years earlier than the time of Attila. It was common amongst Iranians like the Persians, Medes and Scythians from the 6th century BC onwards, but it had long fallen out of use by 400 AD. Axes during the Migration Period looked like this:

DRINK!

13.34: There is no way in hell Alexander would have worn a helmet like that. He might have worn an Attic helmet:

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/59/be/d0/59bed059fbb1c61540f0b54842242516--spartan-helmet-helmets.jpg

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/66/7c/30/667c30f3baba85ac48685d6fbb8bc067.jpg

But not the bizarre monstrosity here. DRINK!

14.23: They need to trademark the term ""Physics for killing"".

14.55: The narrator asserts Attila wore very little body-armour. Now, we have no primary sources that describe what Attila wore, but the ruling classes of steppe societies were the most well equipped and acted as heavy cavalry. The same was probably true for the Huns. As such, Attila probably availed himself of metal scale, lamellar or maille as a sign of his status, and to not die horribly. DRINK!

15.33: They have invited a former UFC fighter to test out the effectiveness of Pankration. The problem here that the modern version has absolutely no connection to the ancient method of combat. There are no surviving schools or tradition to draw on, so the best that can be achieved is to try guess how the ancient Greeks fought. Presenting the current techniques as an accurate representation is absolutely dishonest. DRINK!

19.55: Incorrect Persian shield. DRINK!

20.01: Now they are matching the Hunnic composite bow with the gastrophetes. The problem with this was the gastrophetes was never a common battlefield weapon in the 4th century BC. A better choice would be to use a sling or an Scythian-style composite bow, which were far more common. DRINK!",history,1500707704,ByzantineBasileus,25,268,True,2017-07-22

Carlin briefly mentioned some historians speculate the whole revolution was an elaborate German conspiracy to get Russia out of the war. It's pretty clear Germany saw Lenin as someone to keep the Russians preoccupied with internal affairs, thereby easing tension on Germany's eastern front, but my question is is there any solid information (book, article, etc) that specifically explores the topic of, as Dan Carlin described it, a ""covert black op"" waged by Germany to slowly corrupt czarist Russia using communism as a tool. Quite frankly I'm fascinated by the notion of a conspiracy beyond just putting Lenin on a train and sending him to Russia to do his thing.

20,A Review of Ancient Discoveries: Chinese Warfare,"I have always had a particular fondest for Chinese history. My favourite dynasty was the Song, followed by the Ming. As such, I am going to examine a documentary called Ancient Discoveries - Chinese Warfare:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydJqd5hiRkE

My imaginary drink of choice for this session is Baijiu. So let's get our Han on!

0.51: The narrator says China is 5000 years old. This is not true. The earliest supposed Chinese culture is that of the Xia Dynasty, which reigned between 2000 to 1600 BC, but the actual existence of this civilization is much debated. It could have been a mythical originator culture, a collection of bronze-age states that had been reinterpreted by succeeding dynasties to be one centralized government, or it may have existed as traditional accounts say. The one early Chinese civilization we have concrete evidence for is the Shang, from 1600 BC to 1046 BC. As such, China can only be said to be around 3600 years old. DRINK!

0.54: The narrator describes China as having the largest army in the world today. If we are speaking in terms of standing forces, that is correct. However, when one takes into account reserve and paramilitary forces, India, North and South Korea and Vietnam have much larger land forces. DRINK!

0.57: The narrator states China has 60 centuries of military heritage. Considering Chinese civilization officially starts with the Shang, this is so wrong it collapses in on itself and creates a blackhole-like anomaly of factual errors. DRINK!

1.11 - 1.34: Yeah, it's pretty much common knowledge that gunpowder came from China. No-one in the Western World thinks Europe invented it. And most scholars familiar with history also understand that the crossbow and cannon were introduced from China. Also, a lot of the discoveries the narrator mentions were a case of convergent invention, meaning they were created independently in separate parts of the world stemming from the same need. This includes the flame-thrower and catapult. So one can accurately say they were invented in the West, and originated from the Chinese. DRINK!

1.51: The historian states most of the weaponry used in modern warfare has its roots in ancient China. You know, like ships, which were never used by the West, aircraft, tanks, APC, bayonets, helicopters and drones. DRINK!

1.55: The Chinese were thousands of years ahead of their time? Despite certain inventions, the core of Chinese warfare remained identical to other contemporary cultures: infantry and cavalry using weapons and armor like shields, swords, spears, bows and pole-arms. DRINK!

2.49: Starting from 400 BC, the narrator states the goal of each state was to conquer the others and rule China, and they do so by showing a modern map of China. GAAAAAH! The territory ruled by the Qin Dynasty was vastly different to that of China today. This is the state of Qin versus the current borders:

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/87/a5/27/87a5274392858b16821f03207614bbdc.gif

As you can see, Qin is a third of the size. DRINK!

2.53: The Chinese certainly experimented a lot with different weapons in response to different conditions, but to say they ""accelerated the development of killing machines"" is incorrect. For example, gunpowder was supposedly developed in the 9th century AD but the oldest Chinese cannon dates from 1290, meaning it took 400 years of evolution to reach that point. DRINK!

3.06: In 800 BC spears and pole-arms were the most common weapon, not the sword. This was because they were cheaper to create and more effective when used by large numbers of troops. Hand-to-hand fighting would also remain central for 1800 years as well. DRINK!

3.17: Chinese hand-to-hand weapons were not the most lethal the world had seen. They were actually inferior in material to other contemporary cultures. DRINK!

3.30: In 800 BC the Chinese were still working with bronze, not iron. It was the Middle-East that was pioneering metallurgical development. Also, the swords they are showing are a form of Jian that seems quite modern:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Jian_(sword).jpg

This is what a Jian from the Warring States period looks like:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sword_(Jian)_with_Chevrons_LACMA_AC1998.251.20.jpg

DRINK!

3.57: I think we all wish we had 36 inches.

4.05: The narrator says the longest swords in Europe during the time of the Warring States was 27 inches long. European Bronze Age and Iron Ages swords such as the Naue II and those produced by the Halstatt culture could be up to 33 inches long. Seriously, did the writers of this show do any research? Any at all? You can get books at the library that explain this stuff. DRINK!

4.24: ""The result was an incredible level of hardness"". Hehehehehehehehehe.

4.41: I'm not saying it was aliens..........

6.37: The Chinese dagger-axe was hardly the most unique, as its method of fastening it to the shaft was similar to Middle-Eastern bronze-age axes. Here is a dagger-axe:

http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/images/exbig_images/3648463791bed1afbea15eed7c27131b.jpg

Here are bronze-age axes and designs from various cultures:

http://www.larp.com/hoplite/JP4.jpg

http://edgarlowen.com/b3351.jpg

http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/system/files/images/bronze-axe-from-hoard.jpg

It was just an axe with a longer shaft to make it a pole-arm. DRINK!

6.52: As opposed to weapons that just inflicted light punishment.

7.16: As opposed to weapons that were designed to be used with minimum effect in hand-to-hand combat.

7.25: ""To be on the receiving end of just one thrust would have been agonizing"". Hehehehehehehehehe.

7.25: Also, dagger-axes were swung, not thrust. DRINK!

7.33: Meanwhile, to accompany the description of a dagger-axe being swung, a guy just stabs an opponent with a spear. DRINK!

7.37: By 1000 AD China was 2600 years old. Does the narrator not even remember the numbers he said seven minutes previously? DRINK!

7.47: So all the guys making weapons before this date had just been amateurs?

7.53: YOU CANNOT REWRITE HISTORY BOOKS SINCE THERE IS NO TIME TRAVEL OR A PREVIOUS TIMELINE TO ALTER! BAD METAHISTORY DRINK!

7.58: It took many centuries for gunpowder to be refined into a weapon that would change the nature of warfare, whereas the narrator makes it sound like it happened overnight. Also, air-power and nuclear weapons also changed warfare just as much, so to say nothing has altered warfare in such a way since gunpowder is plainly false. DRINK!

8.09: Gunpowder is a 1200 year old invention. Not 1000. Seriously, how the F*ck does the narrator keep making such simple mistakes? DRINK!

9.07: They are having a white European male make gunpowder. CULTURAL APPROPRIATION!

9.46: Pussy!

11.09: The flame-thrower was not new or terrifying by this date. A form of flame-thrower involving greekfire had been used for 350 years by the greatest civilization on Earth: The Byzantines. DRINK!

12.00: NO WAR FOR OIL!

12.44: Glad to see 70's fashion is making a comeback.

14.30: TOO. MANY. JOKES!

16.17: The best tactical position to place a flame-thrower is probably towards the enemy.

18.10: The triple crossbow employed three bows? Get of here with that crazy!

19.02: Full-metal-jacket tipped missiles? What the hell does that even mean?

19.26: ""The power straining to unleash the missile would be freed by banging the trigger"". Hehehehehehehehehe.

-considerable regional power 

-Must use of gunpowder (with canons, muskets, ships), especially at late stages, civs that started the timeline using high amounts of archers, swordsman and etc are not a problem, but later it must be gunpowder focused. Also cavalry is 100% okay at all periods.

-Civs/nations which are not strong enough can still be notified as to be natives, which are small villages you cannot play as and you can find in maps to get help in your gameplay (they offer technologies, trainable units and bonus based in history).

-It can be either a specific kingdom that lasted the timeline, a people (like persia with its various dynasties) or even a region with historical shared government.

-not a must but having a historical of fighting other of the main civs can be a great argument for it

Example of main napoleonic era civs (confirmed):
-france

-England

-Portugal

-italy (peoples)

-Poland/lithuania commonwealth

-Sweeden

-Spain

-Persia (with its various dynasties)

-Otoman empire

-USA (in this case the colony period is taken into account for a diferent gameplay)

-Dutch

-Russia

-Hasburgs, mainly austria

-Holy roman empire (non prussia, austria) germans)

-prussia

-swiss(people again, and this is a interesting one, due to their mercenarie traditions they are a suportive civ for team games!)

-Denmark

-Mughaul empire and other indian states will be there, the problem is how to deal with the 18 century mughaul demisse and if maratha, mysore will be diferent civs or part of it. nothing decided just ideas.

Many of those civs passed by a huge debate if they should have been added, so please explain your point in the adding of a civ!

76,"""A World Lit Only by Fire"" by William Manchester","I just finished an excellent book about ""the medieval mind and the birth of the Renaissance"". The author opens with talking about how most of us could imagine a Victorian street or colonial town, but outside of royal course and chambers, we hardly have any picture of or understanding of daily life in the middle ages. He goes on to provide that, then follows the evolution of the medieval mindset until the completion of Magellan's circumnavigation. 

What really struck me was his ability to give a convincing explaination of why people failed to do things that are painfully obvious in retrospect, i.e. the Catholic Church recognizing their need for reform, or it taking so long for anyone to stand up to the horribly currupt Popes, or why academia developed the way it did.

81,The Greeks Workout?,"It's apparent that the Greeks knew what a ripped body looked like by their stone sculptures of them.

I'm wondering if they used ropes or just did gravity resistance excercises like push ups, squats, etc. If they had used stones, well they might have used non-modified stones.

How an ancient civilization perfected the human body with no technology or research, but today 90% of our workout programs don't work for everybody.

So, I'm a bit of a sword nerd. I decided to consolidate my knowledge on wootz into a fairly easy to digest format.

Wootz is a type of steel, which hails from India and was first mentioned around 300BCE, and was produced in sites in Konasamudram, Nizamabad district  and Andhra Pradesh (Lowe 1990; Voysey 1832) and Gatihosahalli in the Chitradurga district of Kamataka (Freestone and Tite 1986; Rao 1970).

It is a heterogenous steel, with a soft base and hard carbides. The iron ore used in india at the time contained vanadium which assists in carbide segregation, giving wootz its unique properties. (J.D. Verhoeven, A.H. Pendray, W.E. Dauksch, 1998)

Since 1984, it has been the headquarters for the country's secret intelligence police force (xpost r/evilbuildings)","[Here's an album with pictures plus more while it was under construction](https://imgur.com/a/e5Epi) 

El Heliocide | Caracas, Venezuela

It was supposed to be a drive-in mall, the only one of its kind, where drivers could spiral up and down, parking right in front of the business of their choice. It was halted shortly before completion; then abandoned to a fate that included oblivion and decay; multiple failed governmental projects; occupation by squatters and intelligence police; and episodes of drugs, sex, and torture; all sources for an endless number of legends, each more fascinating than the last.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

Here's a brief history: 

In the 1950s, the combination of thirty years of oil revenues and a dictator, General Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, bent on modernizing Caracas, made Venezuela into a haven for foreign architects looking to express their creativity.

In 1955, the owner of La Roca Tarpeya, a 328,000 square-foot hill, wanted to build a lucrative commercial development. A modern shopping mall, ‚ÄúEl Helicoide: was designed to include large exhibition halls; an automobile showroom; a gym and swimming pool; restaurants; nurseries; discotheques; a giant cinema; a first-rate hotel; a heliport; and a full system of internal access with diagonal elevators and mechanical stairs

And then it all came to a halt‚Äîa slow, gradual halt that took everybody by surprise and from which El Helicoide never recovered. In January 1958, Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez was overthrown. Construction actually began in October 1958, under the provisional military government of Wolfgang Larraz√°bal, which allowed the building to go forward as long as its developers hired a large number of unemployed workers, part of a national emergency plan. They did, and El Helicoide roared on with 1,500 men working in three shifts round the clock for the next year and a half.

It was democracy that dealt El Helicoide its fatal blow. How exactly this happened is still unclear. Some blame the newly formed government of R√≥mulo Betancourt, which, unwilling to continue and thus legitimate the dictatorship‚Äôs massive urban renewal of Caracas, put conditions on a line of credit that had previously been granted to El Helicoide. The company balked, embarking on a lengthy legal dispute that would end only in 1976 when the empty building became state property. End of story for El Helicoide, the mall.

During the next twenty years, the construction that had made international headlines stood in almost total silence. To their credit, local governments attempted to save the frozen giant. One after another, administration after administration proposed different commercial, cultural, and commercial-cultural plans, twenty-seven in total

One plan did get under way, giving some life to the building‚Äôs empty halls‚Äîif we don‚Äôt count the massive occupation by squatters from 1979 to 1982, that is. Spurred by the official relocation of five hundred landslide refugees in El Helicoide in 1979, small groups began to install themselves in the building. By 1982, the unfinished structure was home to some twelve thousand squatters, all living without basic services in an economically depressed part of town. The building became a zone for trafficking in drugs and sex, with attendant high crime rates. This situation was literally washed away with hydraulic force in 1982 to open the way for the Museum of Anthropology.

The Museum of Anthropology plan managed to finally place on the complex‚Äôs roof the Buckminster Fuller dome, which had been stored for over twenty years at a local warehouse. It didn‚Äôt get much further however and plans for the museum scrapped. 

During the remodel in 1982, The four high-tech Austrian Wertheim elevators,‚Äîeach capable of carrying thirty-two people and designed to move diagonally on a thirtysix degree incline along the hill‚Äôs slope at a speed of 6.6 feet per second‚Äîwere found at Venezuela‚Äôs main port, La Guaira, languishing away incomplete. They had arrived with great fanfare two decades earlier, but by 1982, very few people even remembered what those enormous machines actually were.

Soon after the museum plans were abandoned, another type of occupant began to install itself. Starting in 1984, the Venezuelan secret intelligence police (then DISIP, now SEBIN) gradually began to establish its headquarters in El Helicoide, the perfect panopticon with a 360-degree view of Caracas. A new kind of darkness set upon the building.",history,1499522884,malgoya,3,51,True,2017-07-08

Plus, it gives a really lovely window into daily life in the area throughout the period it covers. 

It's a bit chattier than many history books, and it's name is a bit misleading - it doesn't focus so much on Shakespeare as it does on the oldest surviving pub in London (where he may have drank and performed,) but I think it's well worth a read.

How did they choose their locations? What was the first step of setting up a colony? Did they take over existing towns to use as a foundation or did they build entirely new cities? If so, what would be the first buildings buildings to go up and how long would it take to grow i to a functioning settlement?

69,Is Floki Loki?,"So, I can be an idiot sometimes and not notice things. It took me two viewings of all the seasons of Vikings for it to really hit me that Floki is Loki, so I started doing some reading about Loki. Floki, just superficially, has his makeup rather like the old drawings of Jesters of the time. Also [F]Loki. But also Loki is seen as a trickster -- someone who will go totally against what is expected, and who does things just to stir shit up. As a trickster, he makes disloyal alliances with King Horik and King Harald.

Then this:
""For his many crimes against them, the gods eventually forge a chain from the entrails of Loki‚Äôs son Narfi and tie him down to three rocks inside a cave. A venomous serpent sits above him, dripping poison onto him. Loki‚Äôs apparently very faithful and loving wife, Sigyn, sits at his side with a bowl to catch the venom. But when the bowl becomes full, of course, she has to leave her husband‚Äôs side to pour it out."" [Taken from this page:](http://norse-mythology.org/gods-and-creatures/the-aesir-gods-and-goddesses/loki/)

There's more that doesn't apply to Floki in Vikings, and it's obvious that Michael Hirst takes various bits of history and lore and shuffles them around to make a fascinating whole. It's such a shame that written record-keeping wasn't part of Viking culture, because I'd like to know more.

85,"A Review of Ancient Warriors, Episode 15: The Aztecs","Greeting Everyone! Today  I am focusing my attention upon Ancient Warriors, Episode 15: The Aztecs:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX5HxDHQ05o

Now, I would certainly like to have a traditional Aztec alcoholic drink like Pulque to consume, but ever since that incident with Helen of Troy, a jar of jam and a butt-plug, I have been banned by the Council of Non-Linear Sentients from using my time machine for at least 3 Galactic Rotations. Since my sources assure me that the Aztecs were probably somewhere in Mexico, I have some Tequila to assist me in my journey. So let us being!

1.15: I could be screaming out ""AMERICA WAS NOT DISCOVERED! THERE WERE ALREADY PEOPLE LIVING THERE!"". Fortunately, I am not an idiot. On a global scale it certainly was a discovery. The continent of America was unknown to the rest of the world at this time, and finding the region impacted both Europe and America in monumental ways, the least of which was the Colombian Exchange.

1.23 - 1.39 : The narrator's comments has just caused me to head-desk so hard I think I broke my one of my spines. There were a VAST array of peoples in the Americas, ranging from complex, urban-based societies to hunter-gatherers. Besides the Aztecs you had the Incas, Mayas, Tarascans, the Mapuche, the Chachapoya, the Pueblo cultures, the Mound Builders of Mississippi, the Five Nations and the Hupa. To assume that every single male born within these different societies was expected to be a warrior, and that every single civilization waged war to acquire sacrificial victims is an act of cataclysmic ignorance, at the very least. DRINK!

1.58: The fact that the artefacts look like the Aztec version of the Annoying Orange makes the constant cut-aways look hilarious, not foreboding.

2.32: Only a small proportion of the expedition of Cortez were mounted, so it is more accurate to say they marched. Also, the valley was named Anahuac, or Land Between Waters, not the Shadow of Death. DRINK!

2.50: The Aztecs did not have a kingdom. Their state was a coalition between three separate cities called the Triple Alliance, and was ruled by a Huey Tlatoani, or Great Speaker. The Huey Tlatoani was an individual selected by a council, and the ideology and function of this office was very different from that of a European-style king. DRINK!

3.15: CONQUISTACEPTION!

3.30: THEY WERE NOT RIDING! DRINK!

3.48: Stained in infamy? According to whom? The narrator is obviously talking about blood, but to the Aztecs that was quite normal. DRINK!

4.01. That statue either just had an orgasm or their first cup of coffee for the morning.

4.23: People hated dubstep even back then.

5.04: Once again, Terror the Chihuahua is used to spread chaos across the countryside.

5.19: THE AZTECS NEVER THOUGHT THE CONQUISTADORS WERE GODS! WHY CAN'T THAT MYTH DIE ALREADY! The only source we really have for this is one of Cortes' letters to the Emperor Charles, and many historians think that Cortes merely misunderstood Aztec diplomatic rhetoric. DRINK!

5.57: Okay, thanks to hipsters I cannot take those ear-plugs seriously anymore.

6.34: The narrator keeps assuming Aztec = Tenochtitlan. There were two other cties involved in the creation of the empire, Tlacopan and Texcoco. Yes, Tenochtitlan became the senior power, but it was still a multi-polar affair. DRINK!

6.42: Just because one was born an ""Aztec"" does not mean they were automatically a warrior. The Aztecs maintained a class-based society. You had the pƒ´piltin, or nobility, the macehualtin, or peasants, as well as pochtecah, who were merchants and tlacotin, or slaves. The training and up-bringing of such people varied based on their class. The macehualtin, although subject to some military training and conscription, were mainly agriculturalists in terms of function. If they were called away to fight too much than the farming system would be disrupted. Although there existed schools to train youths in warfare, this was mostly likely restricted to a certain proportion of the population since, as a subsistence-based society, the children of peasants were needed to work on communal farms. What the narrator really means when he refers to Aztec youth is the children of the nobility or the military orders like the Jaguar and Eagle Warriors. DRINK!

7.11: The god Huitzilopochtli was not the ""model for every warrior"". Many Aztec nobles were trained in schools called calmecac, which had specific patron gods. Quetzalcoatl was also depicted as a soldier. Xipe Totec was also a deity of war. DRINK!
8.20: Warfare was an important part of Aztec ideology, but it was hardly their life-blood. They were not so one-dimensional. Aztecs were also talented merchants, architects and artists, and warfare was often a just tool to achieve specific economic or political aims, rather than being an objective in and of itself. DRINK!
9.16: Bows and slings were not really the weapons of ""warriors"", that is those who fought in close combat and attempted to acquire prisoners for sacrifice. Bows and slings were used by peasant levies as a prelude to fighting. If you look at the artwork depicting Eagle and Jaguar warriors, they used shields, mƒÅcuahuitl and spears. DRINK!

9.30: The narrator is talking about a mƒÅcuahuitl, but the image is of an obsidian spear-head. DRINK!

10.26: Worst advertisement for a fast-food restaurant ever.

10.17: ""I call dibs on the wings, you guys can have one of the legs!""

11.32: Again, the Aztecs did not have a king. DRINK!

13.16: The people of Meso-America did not lack the wheel, they just had no use for it. DRINK!

13.29: If the priests were behind scouts and raiders they could not be marching ahead. BAD SPAITAL REASONING DRINK!

14.45: There are no historical accounts of Aztec warriors being capable of self-powered flight. DRINK!

14.55: Holy shit that has to be the worse re-enactment fight scene I have ever seen.

15.40: ""And then erupted in a frenzy as they pounced"". Hehehehehehehehe.

16.47: That footage is funny if you imagine the camera-man is being chased by a big spider.

18.01: Much like my last girlfriend.

19.17: Fuck it, I'm just gonna slam the rest of the bottle and call it a day.

Well, that is it for the Ancient Warriors series. Thank God. There was still six minutes of the documentary remaining, but it was just a long ""Cortes = Quetzalcoatl"" monologue, and I just couldn't take it anymore.

94,Blown away Re: Palestine under Brotish occupation 1917 - 1939,"I stumbled upon the Martyr Made podcast and the first series is a history of the modern Isreal-Palestine conflict. I'm only up to the start of WW2, but it's kinda rocked my world.

I was raised as a reformed Jew in the US. We were taught that the state of Isreal was basically a 'sorry about the Holocaust' gift from the world and that the Arabs hated us so much that they immediately formed a coalition to makes sure Jews were not allowed to have their own country. Essentially, the territorial sovereignty of Isreal is the guaranty that the holocaust can never be repeated .. at least that was the impression on 10 - 13 year old me. For those not familiar, reformed Judiasm is the most accommodating American umbrella - with conservative and orthodox being the other two.

The podcast really paints Chaim Weissman as an omnipotent figure, that he was able to intercept and spin many reports coming back from the local authorities and also convince British the Zionist movement was all powerful (including that they could torpedo American support for the British war efforts). How accurate is this? 


It almost stretches belief - is this a case of revisionist-revisionist history, that British historians are trying to absolve themselves of their role is the mess that is the middle-east (ex. Bafluer declaration, Sykes-Picot)


Edit: The podcast host doesn't disclose his background, but he's engaging and often references primary sources as he tells the story. http://www.martyrmade.com/about-martyrmade/",history,1499610863,Mtl325,2,0,True,2017-07-09

2,WWII enlisted jacket - is it real?,"Edit: here is the link to the photos (https://m.imgur.com/a/m7pWb). Hopefully that works as I think it does. Daylight proved just as hard to get good photos since the glass is highly reflective (I was told it is a preservation glass and somewhat thicker). Some angles arent great and the focus isn't perfect in every photo, but I did what I could to minimize reflections. Guess non perfect/not ideal photos means even more downvotes than before photos were posted. Wow, rough crowd! 

So a family business was closing and offered some free items to me. One the items I decided to take home is a shadow box frame with what appears to be a WWII enlisted jacket inside. I've done some research, but I really don't know anything about WWII uniforms. I'm wondering if any of it/some of it/all of it are real and belong together, and if I am correct in the items being from WWII. I will try to get pics tomorrow. 


The jacket (based on some research) appears to be an army enlisted jacket. It is dark green wool from what I can tell. There are 4 pockets, 2 on each side with small US eagle brass buttons on each. There are no rank patches or emblems on either arm. The left upper arm has a Pacific Ocean area patch (blue background, red arrow, white stars) that doesn't look modern. As in, the patch has a somewhat ""rough edge"", is hand stitched on the jacket, and the border of the patch is stitched rather than a finished edge. The left forearm area has a single patch with 5 gold bars. This also appears worn with a few small holes in the patch background and again a rougher edge (though not as rough as the other patch) with some minor flaws (bars aren't perfectly straight, stitching is a bit crooked). 


The buttons all appear to be the standard brass buttons from the era with the US eagle. All but one appears to be original (one is much brighter and I suspect is a replacement). On the right lapel is a brass button that says US. On the left lapel is what sort of resembles a vertical propeller with horizontal wings behind it, but it's pretty worn (another reason I question authenticity - army and what might be Air Force together...fishy. Unless Air Force uniforms were also green wool and used the same buttons and patches?). On the right side above the pocket, beneath the lapel/collar is a diamond patch with a gold embroidered eagle in a circle. 


The jacket doesn't appear to be lined with anything beyond the neck/collar area. Beneath that is just the green wool again. That area has some printing in it and someone's name written in some sort of black ink (hand written) in the same area. The printing is done by machine/stamp but is definitely not perfect. It says ""42 R"" with ""M 5554"" below. I don't have access to the inside of the jacket or any other tags that may exist without removing it from the frame, and I'm not willing to do that to preserve the mounting/display. 


Does anyone have any input? Would love to know whatever I can on this since I'm sure with it hanging there will be questions! Thanks in advance! ",history,1498884940,Goldenplum38,33,12,True,2017-07-01

14,"A Review of Deadliest Warrior, Season 2, Episode 6: Roman Centurion Versus Rajput Warrior","Greeting Everyone! It is time for another review and, being the masochist that I am, I thought another bout with Deadliest Warrior! Would be suitable. So today I am covering Season 2, Episode 6 - Roman Centurion Versus Rajput Warrior:

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x517l13

As Rajputs are a member of the Glorious Sanskrit Master Race, my imaginary alchohol shall be Royal Mawalin. So let us begin!

0.12: HOLLYWOOD SPINNING! DRINK!

0.23: So with the two warriors introduced, I find I have several objections to the matchup. Although centurions frequently fought in battle, they were officers first and foremost, and so the ability to command and maintain the loyalty of their men was far more important than their skill at dueling. Assuming the centurion comes from the Republican period, then they would be elected by the rank and file on the basis of how respected and competent they were. A good fighter does not automatically make a good leader. By comparison, the Rajput would have been raised from birth to be a warrior, and be incredibly proud of their heritage and religion. Although written much later than the period depicted in the episode, James Tod in ""Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan"" states that:

'In the mythology of the Rajputs, of which we have a better idea from their heroic poetry than from the legends of the Brahmans, the sun-god is the deity they are most anxious to propitiate; and in his honour they fearlessly expend their blood in battle'
This is a culture that would not be well suited to drill and formation fighting, and so the two fighters have different styles of battle, varied skill sets and so cannot be compared to one another.

1.21: The narrator says Rome had the first professional army. No. The first professional army was recruited by Sargon of Akkad, who had 5400 men. Other states prior to the Romans had standing forces as well, such as the Achaemenids who maintained a central army of 20,000 soldiers, DRINK!

1.38: HOLLYWOOD WEAPON TWIRLING! DRINK!

2.05: Quote of the day: ""My eyes sees physics for killing.""

2.40: Okay, so the first 'expert' is Terence Rotolo, whom a quick search on IMDB reveals he is a stunt coordinator and actor, and further searches using my Google-Fu has revealed no other information. So, not a historian or experimental archaeologist. DRINK!

3.09: The next is Matt Lasky, who is also an actor and stuntman. Further searches reveal no academic credentials. DRINK!

3.56: The narrator says that the dominance of Rome was because of it's full-time army. This is true, but it is worth pointing out that Rome had achieved super-power status during the Republican period by actually recruiting from its citizens for specific campaigns only. At that stage Rome raised armies based on need, rather than maintaining a standing force.

4.44: The first Rajput expert is called Gugun Deep Singh, which sounds like the name of a character created by George Lucas. Gugun is an actor, and also a Canadian, which for some reason feels very wrong. Again, no background in history. DRINK!

5.08: After this is Bhajneet Singh, yet another actor without any proficiency in history, as far as I can see. DRINK!

6.07: The narrator states the Rajput fighting style was based on 10,000 year old martial art which was a forerunner of Kung-Fu. This is blatantly and hilariously wrong. DRINK!

7.12: HOLLYWOOD SPINNING!

7.55: The first Rajput weapon is the Katar. Most sources and artwork I have seen indicate that the Katar was really only common from the 16th century AD onwards, such as this:

http://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/view/19836024?
width=3000&amp;height=3000

My instincts tell me associating this weapon with a 10th century AD Rajput warrior is highly anachronistic, so DRINK!

7.58: The design of those weapons seem to date from the 17th century AD onwards, based on the collection here:

http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search#!?department=4&amp;perPage=100&amp;geolocation=India&amp;sortBy=Relevance&amp;sortOrder=asc&amp;offset=0&amp;pageSize=0

DRINK!

8.42: This test has finally convinced me that sharp pieces of metal can penetrate human skin.

8.54: This carnage seems highly uncharacteristic of a Canadian.

9.33 Annnnnnd now we have the super historical butted maille. A friend of mine, Thegn Thrand, discussed the inaccuracy of this here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmHdD_ngUps
DRINK!

9.52: Butted maille, placed over an object without padding, can be pierced easily. Whodathunk?

10.42: The first Roman weapon is the...... dolabra, which was never a weapon. It was a construction tool. There is only one account of the dolabra being used offensively. Tacitus mentions that pickaxes were used to kill armoured gladiators:

http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/3C*.html

Additionally, as centurions were officers, they would not have used the dolobra anyway. Their job was to oversee, not dig. DRINK!

11.38: One of the Rajput experts claims the Romans never faced a sword with the capacity of the Khanda. Yup, Romans never encountered deadly cutting blades like the Celtic broadsword, Iberian Falcata or Thraco-Dacian Falx. DRINK!

13.20: Oh look, more butted maille. DRINK!

19.03: That Scutum is about as unscutum as you can get. This is what it looked like:

An actual Scutum from Imperial rome looked like this:

I believe John Hancock at one point was President of the Continental Congress, was this the de facto head of state?

40,Vandal and Ostrogothic raiders returning to scandinavia?,"Sorry if my question seems unorganized, but I heard this from a guy who was an amateur historian. He told me that the Goths and vandals (or maybe some other raiders who came from Scandinavia which is relevant because I live in Sweden) left Scandinavia and the Baltic area  because of cooler temperatures and moved south were they as we all know came into conflict with the Romans. And as we all know they eventually completely conquered the western Roman Empire. Then this guy told me that when Justinian (and my man Bellisarius) reconquered much of what had been west Rome, Justinian banished these people, so many returned to Scandinavia, where they yet again came into conflict with their own people, those that decided to stay up north. Many apparently built fortresses to protect them from those who had returned from the south. He also referenced that Gotland has a high frequency of roman coins. So, what of this is true? And can you put these events in a broader context? Is this how Vikings got runescript inspired by Greek symbols? Through their ancestors raiding the Mediterranean long ago?

64,"A Documentary Review of Ancient Warriors, Episode 11: The Vikings","This is yet another review I did for r/badhistory. It was about the favourite of Thoraboos everywhere, Ancient Warriors, Episode 11: The Vikings:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unu_AHEEzhM

On that occasion I had with me some nice Honey Mead. So put on your horned helmets, lash yourself to a dragonboat, and dive in with me!

0.38: The episode begins with an artist adding illustrations to a newly written fantasy book.

1.10: The last dragon died in 1037 BC, so they had been extinct for over 1700 years by this point. 

1.25: The ""Marauders from the North"" came from Denmark, Sweden and Norway, so at the most they would be marauders from the East if we take out starting position as being in Lindisfarne, Northumbria. DRINK!  

1.27: There was no 'peace' to shatter. At the time of the raid on Lindisfarne in 793 AD, Northumbria had experienced a civil war between Eadwulf and Osred for the throne of the kingdom that had seen the birth place of history's greatest Marty Stu, Bamburgh, laid siege to. There were also frequent raids by the Picts into the region. DRINK! 

1.47: He just mentioned the Dark Ages. He. Just. Mentioned. The. Dark. Ages. THE DARK AGES! THERE WERE NO ACCURSED DARK AGES (I would have said G*ddamned, but I'm trying to follow the Seven Laws of Noah)!! In fact, there were many innovations, achievements and advancements in Europe during the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries. First amongst these was the Carolingian Renaissance, which included the creation of a script called Carolingian Miniscule that allowed standardized scholarly writing. Charlemagne also issued the Charter of Modern Thought 787 AD which saw the creation of schools to teach literacy. Alcuin of York, an individual active during this period, produced mathematical problems to be used in teaching, and another individual called Bede produced various works such as the Ecclesiastical History of the English People (props to u/Zaldax for his awesome posts). FOUR DRINKS! DRINK! DRINK! DRINK! DRINK!

1.54: To create the effect of chaos and destruction they had the camera move forward and knock over a candle. Who the hell thought that would be a good idea?

2.00: Two minutes in and I'm already imaginarily drunk.

2.23: White people were oppressing brothers even back then.

3.10: The Vikings were the greatest sailors of their day? The Chinese had been using the stern-mounted rudder for over 600 years by this point, and the Tang Dynasty had invented paddle-boats. Mediterranean sailors were using lateen sails which had yet to be adopted by Northern Europe and allowed boats to sail against the wind. Likewise the Arabs and Indians had trade networks stretching across Eastern Africa and South Eastern Asia, places Europe only had the faintest idea about. The Vikings were obviously good sailors, but they were not the best, technologically or in terms of navigational knowledge. DRINK!

3.12: Fiercest warriors! Oh man! Thorabooism rears its ugly head. Now, the Vikings were good fighters, but one must remember they were drawn from particular social classes: the karls (freemen) and  jarls (the nobility). These individuals were wealthy enough to provide their own equipment and often practised a martial tradition influenced by constant blood-feuds and local insecurity, but only the richest had swords and maille. The average warrior had a spear, a shield, an axe and was unarmoured. However, you collect a number of these individuals and launch them against an agricultural society with a governmental structure based on personal relationship and where warriors are a minority scattered across various villages and manors, and of course they are going seem unbeatable from the perspective of a frightened peasant. When compared to more complex societies, they were severely outclassed. The Byzantines, Tang China, Persia and the Arab-Islamic world had long maintained standing forces with a plethora of military manuals and established tactical formations and manoeuvres. Their infantry alone had superior equipment and drilling to the average Viking, but when you include cavalry and their various forms (horse archers, kataphractoi, light horsemen), the Vikings are outclassed at every level. DRINK!

3.35: The helmet and maille coif are far too early for the time period. It appears to be a chapel de fer or kettle-hat from the 14th century onwards, not the Viking Age. DRINK!

3.52: ""Ivarr the Boneless"". Hehehehehehehehe.

4.07: That image of Egill Skallagr√≠msson is from the 17th century and shows him with what appears to be a falchion and chapel de fer/kettle-hat. Describing it as anachronistic would be an understatement. DRINK!

5.42: Death-Metal has always had its detractors. 

6.56: Same anachronistic image. DRINK!

7.39: ""Warriors charge into battle shielded by Odin, god of war"". Odin was never used as a shield because they could never find a place to attach the handle.

8.18: As opposed to those Viking poseurs who only got into it after it became popular.

9.17: ""As boat builders these men were unrivalled"". Gahhhhhhh! See my previous comments on sailing. DRINK!

9.37. I've said this many times but you CANNOT CHANGE HISTORY! There was no time-travel and no existing time-line to undo. You cannot alter what has not yet happened. BAD METAHISTORY DRINK!

9.58: ""Such ships penetrated far up-river"". Hehehehehehehehe. 

10.18: ""They gave it names like Long Serpent"". Hehehehehehehehe.

10.54: Absolutely false. Viking ships lacked the appendages required to tie knots.

11.00: ""Against the swift longship there was no defence"". Except by other ships, such as the navy Alfred the Great constructed which defeated many Vikings at sea. DRINK!

11.06: Now I have the image of several dozen Vikings leaping out of the bushes wearing party hats and crying out ""Happy Birthday!"".

11.52: Not even the Vikings were crazy enough to play a game as destructive as Monopoly. 

12.03: ""For when a Viking just needs to look fabulous!"".

12.11: Washed every Saturday? Well just look at Mr Fancy over here!

13.59: That maille appears to be butted rather than riveted. Butted maille was never used as it split easily and was poor at defending against thrusts. DRINK!

14.43: And as a perfect example of a Berserker, or Bear-Skin, they show us a wolf. DRINK!

17.40: There is some debate over who founded Kiev. It seems it may have been an existing settlement prior to the arrival of the Rus. DRINK! 

18.02: IT IS THE HAGIA SOPHIA, NOT THE AYA SOPHIA! AT THE TIME IT WAS NOT A MOSQUE! IT WAS A CHURCH, THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD! IT IS NOT A MOSQUE NOW ANYWAY! IT IS A MUSEUM! THE WRITERS NEED TO BE EXECUTED! THEY SHOULD ASKHDHFDHFPIAYSWYPIYHEFHEBEASPOIUYQWIYFIGJCBMXNOFRHEHPORPOFLKDNFR......

18.57: Recover from aneurysm.  

19.18: That picture of Egill again. Also, he seems to be doing the Dreamworks eyebrow thing. DRINK!

19.35: Does that belt-end hanging under the shield look like what I think it looks like?

20.13: That guy on the left has no weapons or protection whatsoever.
 
20.24: Not even that kind of camera effect can hide how badly staged this re-enactment scene is. 

20.29: ""Okay guys, you tap my shield with your weapon, and I'll do the same to you so it looks like we're busy.""

20.38: A guy has a kite-shield, which was not really used in 937 AD when the Battle of Brunanburh took place. DRINK!

 20.59: The Normans were not Vikings. They were Normans, a settled, agricultural people that maintained heavy cavalry rather than infantry as their primary fighting style, were Christian and spoke a Romance-based dialect. DRINK!

21.54: There are no accounts of Vikings using longships to travel to Mars. DRINK!

24.03: So Phil Grabsky did all that? I WILL HUNT HIM DOWN AND CARVE OUT HIS HEART!

The next episode of the series I shall review will focus on the Aztecs, and I should hopefully have it done next weekend. See you then!

85,Why did US rebuild Japan after WW2?,"From what I gather so far, there are two main reasons. But I'm still not sure the motivation of US that they did that post-ww2.

One is the rising communist force in Japan makes that US had to convert this country to a capitalist country. 

Two is reinstalling the government to a more western/US like module can be in more favor of US and not letting history of Nazi Germany happen again. The sanctions and punishments after WW1 are the main reason that caused Nazi party came to power, so I think it's a reasonable thing to prevent Japan becoming a second Nazi. 

But mostly the decisions were made by General MacArthur, he is the ultimate authority that drew a modern Japan. There were wartime conferences that dictate how the future of Japan should be, but ultimately it falls back to US's hands. 

And one thing needs notice is that US had fought a war with Japan for least 4 years, and it was direct engagement. While US was lending supplies and other arms through Atlantic, there were indirect engagements with Nazi Germany's submarines. And only in 1944, in D-Day, US had took part into the European theatre and opened western front. 

So a country that was warring with you for least 4 years and you agree to help the country reborn? This kind of looks absurd to me, added that what Germany had become after WW2. I feel like Japan was way more better treated. 

Thoughts? 

EDIT: Thanks for the incomes guys! Really appreciate what you have taught me. And yes, my mistake, US had direct land engagements in European Theatre against Axis power before D-Day. First entrance would be Operation Husky, invading Axis controlled Italian island of Sicily. And before this, US had first entered the west theatre (direct land engagements) in Operation Torch, November 1942, and later the North Africa Campaign, besides the submarine war in Atlantic.",history,1498389232,EugeneRider,1135,4887,True,2017-06-25
86,Why was the US not cut down in size after the Great Powers realized the Americans were quickly overcoming almost all European countries combined in terms of manufacturing and raw material extraction?,"I've read a fair share of books on the time period between 1400s and 2000s and I've developed this question through the years.

I read Germany was seen as a threat after France got beaten by Prussia (who obviously later became Germany) in one of the most one sided wars ever in Europe between powerful nations before WWI. Then just before WWI Germany had the highest population of Europe behind Russia, but the US by then had even more. Then Germany had the industrial potential to produce around 20-30% of the worlds manufactures and raw materials extraction such as iron ore, rubber and such things, while the US was producing nearly 50 if not more % of everything. These figures are based on Paul Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of the Great Nations, a source I'm not entirely sure it's reliable but to me it seemed so.

My point is, it was obvious from the get go the US was a much bigger threat to the economic balance of powers even though Germany was more of a threat on the military aspect of said balance, and while it seems rational to neutralize the military threat first, I wonder why Europe never thought of coalescing together against the US and probably even Russia given their (to me) unfair extreme advantages at the time, which only grew bigger as time went on, specially after WWII.

Seems to me it was more feasible to give Germany a break after WWI and not antagonize it forever with the Treaty of Versailles and instead band together against obviously rising Super Powers. 

I know ideologically democracies don't really like fighting each other but still, feels unfair how much power the Americans were left alone to tap in the American continent virtually all to themselves the same way Russia was left alone to expand to enormous proportions.

TL DR: America was pretty much the richest country in the world and rising stupendously while all the other economies of the world were stagnating in comparison and yet they were left alone by Europe and thus became the strongest nation of the world. Why?

Edit 1: thank you all for your answers it's been thoroughly interesting to read your point of views. I know Europe hated each other at the time and this kind of cooperation would have been nigh impossible. Also it would have been economic suicide like a couple responders said. The oceans protected the US indeed. And like other people said the EU may have been the response to this rise in US/Russia preeminence.

One could even argue that having this nearly omnipotent state may be preventing the world from falling into constant war like in the entirety of human history and the rise of the Super Powers may be, in part, be the reason for this time of ""peace"" at least in the form of no total wars.

I guess I can just wonder how the world would function if Europe forced Texas, California, the area of the thirteen colonies, the mid east/west to be separate countries in an effort to keep such a powerful nation in check.

45,My wife and I have a Roosevelt's camera,"Not sure if this would interest r/history or not but I figured I'd share the story.


Back when my wife and I were dating and we moved in together she was unpacking her things and said to me ""oh yea, this old camera. It belonged to someone important or something"" which of course piqued my interest. It's an old [Rolleiflex Compur Rapid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolleiflex) (edit, apparently that's not the camera model) which her grandfather had given her for school (art major). The story she got from her grandfather was that he got it from a friend who had a camera shop, someone traded it in, and the guy at the shop said it ""belonged to a Kennedy or something."" 


[here's the camera in question](http://imgur.com/a/uMmZv) and obviously no one had done an research into the camera to figure out who owned it because you don't need a PhD to read the label on the inside of it. Based on the serial number the camera was from 1958-61 and the address listed was a house built in 1968 in D.C. Near the Potomac river. 


Now there have been 4 Kermit Roosevelts throughout history, Teddy Roosevelt's [son](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Roosevelt), [grandson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Roosevelt_Jr.), great-grandson(no data on him), and [great-great-grandson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Roosevelt_III). I reached out to Kermit III to see if he had any insight and he very kindly replied. While he didn't have any recollection of the camera itself he confirmed that the address was his grandparents and given the 'mrs.' title it looks like the camera belonged to the wife of [Kermit Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Roosevelt_Jr.)


Kermit Jr. Had a long history in U.S. Intelligence dating back before the creation of the CIA and later the CIA itself. His most notable contribution being [Operation Ajax.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)


I'm sure this camera lived a perfectly normal life taking family photos, it's unlikely it was taking classified photos of covert US operations to overthrow foreign governments, but it's still a fun conversation piece.

Furthermore the reason why it hit so hard in Europe was because they hadn't been exposed to it in centuries and indeed, later pulses seem less catastrophic.

Or was it as bad in Asia and just doesn't get the same press thanks to Euro-centralism?

He's always interested me as a historical figure, and reading more about him is inspiring, to say the least. I learned that he suffered an injury from a British officer's sword when he was captured in 1781. According to 'American Lion' by Jon Meacham (a fantastic source on Jackson's life), the officer demanded that Jackson, 13 at the time, shined his boots. He refused, and the officer slashed at him. Jackson blocked the sword with his arm, leaving a gash along his arm and forehead. Jackson later recalled ""the sword point reached my head and has left a mark there... on the skull, as well as on the fingers.""

The incident left a scar, but it doesn't appear in any portraits or illustrations of Jackson. So, my question is this:

What did this scar look like, was it noticeable in his adulthood, and where exactly was it? Any information would be very helpful.

If anyone else is interested in Jacksonian history, I would recommend Meacham's 'American Lion'. It's been a very insightful source for my project so far.",history,1497736796,Realm117,4,5,True,2017-06-17
66,Some Recognition for BAD ASS OF THE WEEK,"I've been reading BAOTW on and off for the past few years. I feel the depth and detail the author pours into his work unfortunately goes without much notice. The stories he shares and in the manner he delivers them seem right up /r/History -- and all of Reddit's -- alley for history buffs and new comers alike! 

It can seem intimidating to see way more than one hundred different characters and bad-asses (some fictional) from different eras and battles, and decide where to plunge. So I'll just post my personal favorites with a small blurb from the author himself added: 

* [The Swiss Pikemen: The most dangerous infantry unit of the Middle Ages.](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=31684493594)

* [**Count Rochefoucauld - WWII French espionage expert who once stole a limo from the Gestapo.**](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=390735217925)

* [Michiel de Ruyter - Dutch Admiral who commanded ships in 7 wars and once stole the flagship of the English Navy from its home port.](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=579429818534)

* [William McBryar - Buffalo soldier and twenty-year U.S. Army veteran, he received a Medal of Honor fighting the Apache and was one of the first black officers in the history of the U.S. military.](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=939522632442)

* [**Daniel Inouye - WWII Japanese-American killed 25 Germans with one arm.**](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=62238721615)

* [Simo H√§yh√§ - More confirmed kills than anyone else in any other war. Just sayin'.](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=474030732596)

* [**Sekonaia Takavesi - Fijian SAS hero single-handedly held off 200 communists with an anti-tank cannon.**](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=253598521755)

Bolded ones are MEGA favorites and highly recommend, and there are honestly so many many more.

It's also fantastic because some of the pictures added along could feature numerous times on /r/HistoryPorn. 

Finally, nothing like shedding tears thinking how all these great men and women of history made such massive sacrifices for so many people they would never have the chance to meet!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVjQcINBUiw

My focus on Indian history has always been the 16th century and the Rajputs, so examining this period was a fun learning experience as I picked out inaccuracies. 

0.45: The Narrator says the elephant has been both a god and a weapon. Obviously he is referring to Ganesh. The problem is Ganesh was not an elephant, he was a Deva (divine spirit or god) who merely had the head of an elephant. DRINK!

0.50: Mauryan war elephants are depicted. One problem, there tusks are blunted. This is practice common for working elephants, but not for war elephants, as they were trained to gore their opponents. This is what a Mauryan war elephant would have looked like:

http://wildfiregames.com/forum/uploads//monthly_05_2012/post-130-0-75326400-1337222277.jpg

DRINK!

1.57: The narrator refers to the Mauryan Empire being governed by a king. The title of king would have been pradesha chakravartin, meaning a ruler of a particular region, but the Mauryan ruler was titled chakravala chakravartin, which means universal ruler and is more appropriately translated as emperor. DRINK!

1.59: Narrator confuses Star Wars character for an Indian monarch.

3.09: Apparently the Mauryan army was made up of basketball players.

3.25: If this is how you get conscripts I can see why the Vietnam War was so unpopular in the US.

4.07: This guy has no idea how to play tic-tac-toe.

5.16: The narrator says the archer belonged to the Kshatriya varna, or the warrior caste. Such an individual would not be just an archer. They would have trained in a variety of weapons including swords, spears and maces. They would have also been horsemen, charioteers and infantry. Not so much an error as a failure to elaborate on the martial diversity of the role.

7.04: The person narrating this portion has an Indian accent. The text the individual is speaking of is the Indika, by Arrian, a Roman writer. Anybody reading this text would have had a general ""Mediterranean' accent in the time period. DRINK!

8.29: Okay, those arrows have no fletching and the arrow-heads are too large and appear to be made of cardboard. DRINK!

8.34: Those guys in the background appear to be just gently tapping each other's shields with their weapons.

9.16: The Narrator says Ashoka had 8000 elephants. I have no idea where he got this figure from. Megasthenes mentions Chandragupta had 9000 elephants, but that was twenty years before the period in question. DRINK!

12.09: Warriors are marching with their swords held upwards. This would tire the arms rapidly. The swords would be held in a sheath, not raised and exposed to the elements. DRINK!

16.35: I know I am being pedantic but that grass too well manicured for the 3rd century BC. DRINK!

18.34: Warriors working alongside elephants would have been armoured. The Arthashastra specifically mentions maille as well as a clubs being utilized as part of the ""standard equipment"" of elephant riders. Their status as the elite of the army would have entitled to them to such equipment as well. DRINK!

19.48: First recorded case of cheerleaders in history.

20.24: The best of the infantry is also suspiciously lightly equipped. DRINK!

24.03: ""When Ashoka died no-one could take his place"". Except for Dasharatha, his grandson, who took his place. DRINK!

Well, that was quite an educational experience. Next I shall review the episode about the Warriors of Ireland.

39,Art and photos of the American Revolution and the American Civil War,"http://imgur.com/a/r8Akc

I've always had a passion for American military heritage, mostly 18th and 19th century.  Within the past few months I have started to collect books containing art and photos of the Revolutionary War and the Civil War.

Despite all the animosity surrounding it, the mythical narrative of the Confederacy interests me more than any subject.  My favorite paintings are those of gray-clad rebel soldiers beneath the battle flag, Confederate cavalry, and Southern icons like Robert E. Lee or Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson.  There are plenty of these to be found in the books, set against grim battlefields and cold winters.

Note:  I planned on taking sample pictures, but things did not turn out so well  Here are the books I own with my short reviews.

http://i.imgur.com/TEurQoq.jpg

""For Us the Living"" is probably my favorite, with impressive paintings by Mort Kunstler.  The pictures within are not always full-size, being accompanied by a few paragraphs detailing the course of the war, but are nevertheless large enough to appreciate.  The book is largely pro-Southern, with more images of Lee, Jackson, and the Confederates more than anyone else.

http://i.imgur.com/IYiGuFi.jpg

""The Civil War in Color"" is a treasure.  It contains a collection of pictures by Matthew Brady, which have been colorized by John C Guntzelman.  The resulting images are spectacular.  Portraits of Lincoln, Davis, Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and more are included.  Images of African Americans (soldiers *and* slaves), cannons, landscapes, ruins, the dead etc are all included.  Browsing through the book makes the Civil War seem a lot closer than it really was, and it really gave me a new perspective on the conflict.

http://i.imgur.com/awIKqUK.jpg

""The New Nation"" provides more artwork by Mort Kunstler.  Excellent paintings accompanied by a few paragraphs detailing the events of the Revolutionary War - much like the above ""For Us the Living"".  I have only recently acquired this book and have yet to delve into it.

http://i.imgur.com/Ji9tdjI.jpg

I regret getting ""The Civil War Paintings of Mort Kunstler, Volume I"".  Don't get me wrong, Mort is an excellent artist, but the size of this book simply doesn't do him justice.  If you want a small book to lay on your table book, it'll do - but Mort's work should be appreciated and I definitely recommend his larger books - like ""For Us the Living"".

http://i.imgur.com/4lTxc4u.jpg

""Civil War Weapons"" is a neat book.  It's a volume of the weapons used in the war, as the name might imply, categorized and in alphabetical order.  Each page includes several pictures, descriptions, and comments made about the weapon during the war.

http://i.imgur.com/Axk3Wp7.jpg

""Witness to the Civil War"" by John Paul Strain includes an array of Civil War artwork, and Strain's work is equal in quality to Mort Kunstler's.  This is a book I just acquired, and I have yet to flip through it, but I can assure you his work is definitely worth a look.

52,"I wrote a long comment in /r/polandball before realising that the comment I was replying to had been deleted, and I'm kinda irritated that I spent 20 minutes writing for nothing, so here is a brief breakdown of how luck helped Hitler's Germany to achieve the early war victories which they did.","- Despite having been at war for a year, the French never really advanced into Germany at all, allowing Hitler to eat Poland, Denmark, and Norway without major pressure in the west. This was a massive blunder, and 

- The Germans decided to go around the Maginot line, which was anticipated and prepared for by the allies (this was the entire purpose of the Maginot line - to force Germany to go through Belgium). They moved their forces north of the Ardennes, believing, quite sensibly, that the Germans wouldn't dare to go through a dense forest with their heavily mobile army. The Germans gambled and went through anyway, which *should* have been a mistake, but they got lucky and were able to punch through, encircling the allied armies within days. This directly lead to the collapse of France.

- France and Britain had not been in the greatest position for war. This was why the leaders of those nations were lenient and appeased Hitler in his annexations of Austria, the Sudetenland, Memel, and Czechoslovakia; the memory of the horrors of the Great War was fresh in the minds of French and British citizens, and they largely wanted no part in another such war, despite Germany's ambitions (in fact, some had sympathy for Germany, and supported the reclamations of German clay which Hitler made). Furthermore, the public wasn't exactly decided on Hitler yet. Indeed, many news companies praised the fascists (*cough cough* The Daily Mail, which ran with an infamous ""Hurrah for the Blackshirts"" headline, and their owner, Viscount Rothermere, was a friend of Hitler and Mussolini) and Oswald Mosely's British Union of Fascists were not unpopular. France was in a period of political turmoil, with communist movements threatening the liberal democracy. Both nations spent the 1930s rearming to face the German threat.

- Stalin's inexplicable lack of belief that German attack was imminent, despite his advisors and spy evidence strongly suggesting it, was part of the reason that the summer of 1941 was so disastrous for the Soviets. 

- Germany really got lucky with their crop of scientists and generals during the period. There were some excellent engineers who gave the early war German divisions an edge with their tanks and planes... Although the Soviets would later completely outclass the expensive, high quality (but unreliable) German designs (e.g. Tiger) with cheap ones which were only two thirds as good, but ten times easier to make (e.g. T-34, the best tank of the war), which lead to the situation where the USSR produced 100 tanks for every one the Germans made in 1944. The ""German blitzkrieg was unexpected"" factor also affected things, albeit less than pop history will have you believe. The French and British knew that war had changed, and the French tanks of choice, namely the Char B and R35, were some of the best tanks in the world at the time. However, it is true that the generals didn't really anticipate the way that the Germans would use their mobile forces, and instead expected tanks to fill a similar role as in WW1, backing up infantry more than anything else.",history,1497140274,plazmablu,14,35,True,2017-06-10
53,Was The Roman Emperor Hadrian Only Able To Go On A Spending Spree Because Of Trajan's Conquest Of Dacia?,"Reading about the reign of the emperor Hadrian, it seems like a long account of a guy blowing through money really quickly.

But where did the money come from?

It seemed like his ""adoptive grandfather,"" Nerva, struggled with money and had to radically reduce expenditures to keep the empire solvent.

Trajan got to the throne a few years later, but never seemed to have any money issues from the start. Eventually he seemed to get a ton of cash from the conquest of Dacia, but that took awhile.

You could argue that Scotland/Scottish people found America. From James 6/1 having the first town; Jamestown, named after him, numerous presidents and even fried chicken. It's pretty hard not to see Scotland's contributions.

It went two ways though, America influenced modern Scotland through agriculture.

Cotton and tobacco were exported to Glaswegian factories. Cotton built buildings, so did tobacco. Most of which are beautiful, but the factories gave free cartons, whether you smoked or not, this was going on up until the 80s. That's how my grandmother started smoking!

9,Is the USA the only historical world power not in control of its own language?,"Edit: [""A language is a dialect with an army and a navy""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_language_is_a_dialect_with_an_army_and_navy).  The US has a lot of both, yet ""American"" is still considered a dialect of English, rather than its own language.  My question is: is this the first time a world power has been in this position?  Original question below...

A thought I've been kicking around for awhile.  The US influences the English language but the language is still primarily British, with many phrases, euphemisms, and references that are in no way American persisting into American history and culture (ex: Humpty Dumpty is a common US nursery rhyme but is nonsense without its British background; ""it's raining cats and dogs,"" is British before the existence of the US and has no American context but is in use in the US; Shakespeare is taught in American schools over some really relevant and excellent contemporary American lyricists, etc. etc.)  
  
This is relevant because most world powers control and intentionally direct their language to some degree.  On a basic level the Russians control Russian, not the Chinese or French.  As a statement of identity or authority some states have intentionally altered or commanded their language -- Sweden has gone through language reforms, France has an institute that approves official lexicon and has rules to label any product with French as the second language.  Control of the language equals control of perception, as well as control of history and identity.  But it would be ridiculous for the US to suddenly declare ""American"" a language and start using phonetic spelling, etc.  Which leads to the question: has there ever been another world power in the same situation?  
  
Note -- the ""world power"" part is important, there are plenty of examples of one culture adopting another culture's language.  The USA is unique in that it achieved world power status without the benefit of exclusive control over its national language.  
  
Second Edit: I'm aware that languages are organic, and borrow, adapt, and change naturally.  The ""control"" I was referring to was, say, how nationalism can be leveraged as in WW1/WW2.  Or how other sub-cultures can be diminished by forcing acceptance of the ""approved"" dialect (countries such as China do this).  Or how ""culturally inappropriate"" terms can be scratched, or new culturally favorable terms are imposed.  Let's dispel the fiction that languages are unaltered by those in power; they are very much annexed as a form of identity and control.  But my question is: what if China spoke Russian, inherited from Russia?  What if Argentina became a world power -- would they linguistically differentiate themselves from Spanish and say they spoke ""Aregntinan""?  Is there any precedence to the USA not ""owning"" the identity of their primary language?",history,1496473375,your_grammars_bad,26,0,True,2017-06-03
10,"How Many ""Successor-States"" to Rome, even by 1500s?","Much like Alexander the Great's empire, the successor states to Rome saw themselves as the 'true' heir, and the title to said empire was rightly theirs. The Tsars, who's Scythian yoke never saw Roman conquering, and who's Hunn ancestors, slain by the Mongols, pushed Roman decadence back.

The Ottomans considered themselves the third Rome, they had extinguished the truest to successor Rome: Byzantium - they also held Constantinople, and they were the Sultans baptized in fire, wrestling Anatolia away and securing their successor status to Rum, an old Anatolian Sultanate created by Turkic invasions into Byzantium. Truly, they were the Third Rome, Rum, and the truest successor state.

And yet, the Austrians held the Holy (Catholic till MarLuther), Roman (Who knows, Habsburgs were entitled as hell), and a true Empire - not really though. But when enough small-baby sized states come together, with a united leader - it's not that hard to stop invasions. They held Germany, and the Rhine, and - well, what more need be said? Surely, the Emperor to Germans, and Romans alike, was the Habsburg Austrian Reich!

But what about the Pope, who truly held Rome?

And what about Britannia - conquered by Normans, Saxons, Danes, BUT! - Rome was sacked by Visigoths whilst reconquering Britannic territory. Truly, this large, Roman army, would be the last descendant Roman blood into Europe, and thus, the United Kingdom was truly - ROMAN!

19,A Documentary Review of Ancient Warriors: The Celts,"Hello again, r/history. This is another review I did a while ago for r/badhistory. The documentary was Ancient Warriors, Episode Two- The Celts:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT0D9Tx0_N4

My imaginary drink was Canadian Club, so here it is:

0.33: Damn, barely 30 seconds in and already an error. The Celts hardly ""swept down from the mountains"". They lived in a range of climates. Yes, they could dwell in mountain valleys, but also lived in forests, plains, along the coasts and in towns. DRINK!

0.47: The Celts could not at all be described as ""wild"". By the time of Caesar the Celts of Gaul were developing urban societies based on fortified towns called Oppida, and had a range of advanced political institutions including councils and assemblies. Even before that they were settled agriculturalists with a long tradition of metal working and trade. Most Celtic migrations that occurred were a result of population pressure, not a ""wild"" or ""barbaric"" culture. DRINK!

0.52: Celtic fighting traditions were greatly spread across different geographical regions and times, and so cannot solely be categorized as reckless. Yes, there were Roman accounts of Celts launching wild infantry charges, but there are also accounts of them forming organized phalanxes or shield walls, as well as engaging in sieges and guerrilla warfare by the time of Caesar's conquest of Gaul. DRINK!

1.12: ""They fought for nothing less than victory"". Funny, so do most combatants.

1.38: So could Celtic invasions be considered booty-calls?

1.46: ""Wild men of Western Europe"". Gaaaahhhhh! DRINK!

1.58: ""Record their coming with alarm"". Hehehehehehehehehe.

2.42: The idea that we know nothing of the lives of the Celts before their interaction with Rome is absolutely, utterly wrong. Archaeological finds allows us to construct a solid image of what their culture was like. For example, we have the ruins of homesteads, farms and granaries that allow us to reconstruct their daily agricultural existence. Likewise we have burials which enable us to identify cultural important items based on what was found there and recurrent imagery in their jewellery and metal work allow scholars to identify important religious and social themes. DRINK!

4.25: That appears to be nailed-on horseshoe, which is strange as they were first recorded in Europe about the 10th century AD. DRINK!

4.35: I know the narrator is just calling the Celts invincible for effect, but when you look at their numerous defeats by the Romans, they were quite vulnerable to a drilled military force. DRINK!

4.49: The first recorded visit of soccer hooligans to Italy.

7.19: Whilst the idea that they feared no man makes for impressive storytelling, it is quite incorrect. Also, I am surprised the narrator made no mention of the Celt emissaries telling Alexander the Great they only feared the sky falling on their heads, a belief corroborated by the ancient primary source Asterix the Gaul. DRINK!

8.17: The Romans are wearing the equipment based on the Manipular Legion, including scutum shields and maille armour. At this time they would be equipped like Greek hoplites. DRINK!

9:19: Mentions fantasy book as historical source. DRINK!

9.57: I take issue with the claim of the narrator that the Celtic sword was intended solely for slashing. Celtic swords could be quite diverse in their design, and whilst the point of balance was often well forward, indicating it was indeed ideal for slashing, many had acute points and thus were also effective thrusting weapons. DRINK!

10.52: First recorded appearance of effeminate and flamboyant hair stylists.

11.22: We have no way of knowing exactly how disciplined Celtic war-bands were during that battle, so calling them ""mobs"" is quite a leap. DRINK!

11.28: The narrator mentions the Celts were united by their battle-standards featuring animals of the forest. The depicted animal is a horse, a species predominantly found on plains and steppes. DRINK!

12.15: Roman with what appears to be a Pompeii-style gladius. At this stage, the Romans were not even using gladii. Their swords were based on the style of the Greek xiphos. Even if the Romans were using gladii, the Pompeii-style comes from the Principate, not the Republican period. DRINK!

14.01: Okay, I don't know what time period or cultures are being depicted on the carving, but they are certainly not Celts from the 4th century BC. One of the combatants is shown wearing a phrygian cap, which is derived from Anatolia and the Balkans. DRINK!

19.28: ""The Celts deployed back-to-back. Hehehehehehehehehe.

19.44 More Pompeii-style gladii. Urrrgghh! DRINK!

20.13: Now I have an image of an army of Celts as assertively fabulous.

20.46: The Romans were equipped with hoplite shields, which were not small. DRINK!

21.45: ""The Roman thrust their newest weapon, a short blade, into naked flesh"". Hehehehehehehehehe.

23.11: Okay, this claim annoys me. The Celts were in no way driven from all those areas. They just came under the rule of Rome and were gradually assimilated. DRINK!

23.35: GAAAAHHHH! Celtic society developed in Central Europe from the Hallstatt Culture, not from the ""farthest shores of the world"". DRINK!

Well, this documentary certainly would have given me alcohol poisoning if I were actually drinking. If I must be complimentary, I was quite impressed with the visual depictions of the Celts in terms of costume and equipment.

Quite hard to besiege, too since besiegeing armies only could besiege it during low tide and not to mention the pain in the ass it would be to drag siege machines back and forward from Mont Saint Michel every day to avoid the siege machines getting sunk. So given this quite smart position, why did they build a fortified church and small town there instead of a proper castle? A church being placed there doesn't make too much sense since it wouldn't be very accessible, either. So what was the purpose of Mont Saint Michel?

* [The Conquest of New Spain](https://www.amazon.com/Conquest-New-Spain-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140441239) *This is a first-person account of one of the most startling military episodes in history: the overthrow of Montezuma's doomed Aztec Empire by the ruthless Hernan Cortes and his band of adventurers. Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, himself a soldier under Cortes, presents a fascinatingly detailed description of the Spanish landing in Mexico in 1520 and their amazement at the city, the exploitation of the natives for gold and other treasures, the expulsion and flight of the Spaniards, their regrouping and eventual capture of the Aztec capital.*",history,1495876301,bitman_,4,10,True,2017-05-27

16,How and why did far right groups in Europe (primary Germany) blame the Jews for the loss of the central powers during ww1?,"So during the interwar period the idea of the Jews causing Germanys defeat during WW1 became a ""acceptable  idea""  but from a practical and realistic standpoint how was that idea not shot down immediately after its conception? Like the German high command and kaiser during the war weren't Jewish? Jews fought in almost every nation involved in the war. I get that anti Semitism is never really rational but what written or fabricated reports or names would someone in late 1920s Germany try to use to convince a actually college educated adult that the Jews are responsible for Germanys defeat? Now I understand that if someone hated the Jews before ww1 it wouldn't be that hard to convince them, but for actual military leaders, politicians, and solders that actually lived through the war and came to realize the German empire was on its last legs with the entry of Brazil, Portugal, United States, etc. in 1917 how was a connection to the Jews even drawn? Did they blame individual Jewish officers for failed offensives? Did they blame them for the German revolts near the end of the war that led to the Weimar Republic?

Why not send a fighting General such as Benedict Arnold?  The decisions were made shortly before Arnold's treason and Arnold might have accepted it as the honorable command he was so desiring; instead of his treason to the British which produced limited success on the British side. 

Furthermore why just send one large army to the South? Washington knew that head on Cornwallis was the toughest British General;  as Washington had engaged Cornwallis in New Jersey at Trenton and Princeton and the again at Brandywine an Monmouth. Why send one of your worst combat Generals to fight the best British combat General? 

If anything in my opinion Gates should have been assisting the southern command from a tent. 

Did Washington perhaps want to see Gates fail so that Congress would have stopped its support of Gates?

It seems like 1780 was miss a managed campaign and the Americans could have been much more successful without the disaster at Camden. ",history,1495880661,ngenda79,1,1,True,2017-05-27

Growing up in Mexico we are all taught in school that after the war Emperor Maximilian I and his wife Carlotta were executed.

32,In the history of mankind was there another country/society/civilization that experienced Japan's fast aging ?,"As you may know Japan is growing old very fast by any standard. At the current rate by 2040 the average age will be 55. Now Japan is looking at several solutions to solve the retirement problem (women work, late retirement which is one of the reason they are so invested in robotics, immigration although very reluctantly,etc..) but, except for immigration which is politically a very hot button, it doesn't change the bottomline aging problem. Of course they might not stay on that course, the immigration solution for instance might become politically more palatable as the problem grows. Drastic solutions are usually taken in the last minutes when you have your back into the corner. Those kind of forecast are rarely fulfilled exactly as first planned. Still right now Japan doesn't have a real solution. 

And it had me wondering : has this EVER occured before in the history of Mankind ? The way I see it, before industralization, birth rate was for many social reasons always high (religious reasons, social pressure, children as an economic safenet in your old days, lack of contraceptive method,etc...) and average life expectancy was simply not long enough. So in spite of the several millenars long history of Mankind  it might just be litteraly the first time that it occured.

40,Super interesting story about the Manhattan Project and the Atomic Bomb.,"Hey r/history, I'm reading a really good book about the history of the Congo at the moment, and just finished the chapter on World War 2. I learned a really cool story that I would like to share with you.

In 1939, the director of a Belgian uranium mine in the Congo (as it was still a Belgian colony), Edgar Sengier, learned about the military implications of weaponized uranium. Fearing what would happen if the uranium mine or stock fell into the wrong hands, he secretly shipped most of it to a warehouse in New York in 1940. Luckily for him as well, the Governor General of the Congo declared that on the day of Belgium's fall to Nazi Germany, the Belgian Congo would support the Allies, unlike most of the French colonies that aligned themselves with Vichy France.

Sengier moved to New York and was contacted by the U.S. military in 1942 to buy uranium for the Manhattan Project. He told them that ""You can have the ore now. It is in New York, a thousand tons of it. I was waiting for your visit.""

The U.S. Army also secured the remaining 3,000 tons left in the Shinkolobwe mine. The uranium from the Congo was much more plentiful and in much higher quality than the previous uranium being studied by U.S. scientists from North America, and much better and more plentiful than what Germany had access to in Europe.

He was the first non-American civilian to receive the U.S. Medal of Merit. Sengier was also made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Commander of the French L√©gion d'honneur, and Officer of the Order of Leopold and the Belgian Order of the Crown.

The agreement between the United States, Great Britain, and Belgium lasted 10 years and continued after the war. The uranium agreements in part explain Belgium's relative ease in rebuilding its economy after the war, as the country had no debt with the major financial powers.

I thought that was super interesting that one man very few people have probably heard of had such an enormous impact on history, and that the thousands of Congolese workers that died and toiled in the uranium mines could have never had any idea how much they were to change the course of world history, as before World War 2 uranium was primarily used in much more mundane industries like in glass coloring.

The book is Congo: An Epic History of a People if you're interested in 600 pages of African history. :)

Edit: 

So this is getting a lot more attention that I thought it would! I expected maybe five upvotes. To clarify a few things:

I didn't mean to necessarily characterize the Belgian presence in Congo as heroic in this story, as they did truly evil things in Africa. But I think that it's interesting that because of two Belgian colonial officials, instead of Congo joining the Axis powers, like many French colonies joined the Vichy government, they sided with the Allies and the world's largest and best supply of uranium went to the United States instead of Germany. Irrespective of people's opinions on nuclear weapons and their use in Japan, ultimately, keeping nuclear weapons away from Germany was a good thing, even if in other ways, Belgians were still oppressors of the Congolese people.

Additionally I think sub-Saharan Africa's involvement in World War 2 is an extremely undervalued and underrepresented topic. For example, Congolese involvement went well beyond just supplying uranium. Congolese soldiers also fought Italy in the Horn of Africa, fought with the Allies in Egypt, Palestine, and served as medics as far away as Burma. Congo also contributed a lot of material support to the Allied Powers. This is just one chapter of one country's history in Africa that ended up being really important in the long run for how the rest of world history unfolded. I wanted to point out how momentous events in history can be influenced in unexpected ways, like how the roles of the Congolese and Belgians in the Manhattan Project are probably unknown to most people, or at least surprising in their measure of importance.",history,1495898616,LightBlueSuits,455,8187,True,2017-05-27

Specifically: we know of the disillusionment of the soldiers who came home from WWl to become the ""Lost Generation"", but could that term be applied to civilians, as well?

This is surprising given the scale of the conflict between the Ottomans and Byzantium, which resulted in the complete annihilation of Byzantium as a political entity.  Despite the severity and longevity of the conflict, ethnic cleansing does not appear to have been on the agenda of the Ottomans.  Rather religious and cultural conversion was the goal.

By comparison, I understand that the Norwegian/Danish conquest of Northumbria resulted in a permanent change to the makeup of the local population.  The Angle Danelaw is an example of an ""unrestrained"" takeover.  Extreme brutality in conquest.

How accurate is the notion that Turkey is still populated by the ancient Anatolian people?

28,Was Mary Surratt wrongly convicted for her role in Lincoln's assassination?,"I came across a film by Robert Redford called *The Conspirator* which deals with her trial for her role in aiding and abetting JWB and others during their plot to kill Lincoln. It's a fairly sympathetic portrayal focused on the circumstantial evidence and the suspect testimony of two witnesses. In doing some Internet sleuthing, the movie left out quite a bit of other evidence that did not look favorable for her. 
A result, or maybe fall out, of this trial was the SCOTUS ruling the following year that civilians will be given a right to trial by a jury of their peers even during war times and not endure the theater she went through.  Beyond that, I have not found much that suggests there have been calls for her exoneration after the fact or anything like that.

76,How and Why did the North Abolish Slavery?,"After reading several books, articles, journals, and primary sources, I haven't come to a conclusive answer as of yet. From what I've read so far, one of the driving factors was economic interest, as they just weren't as profitable, especially considering the North's economy was far less agrarian than the south.


Another possible reason was the increasing sentiment of anti-slavery and abolition ideals, most likely spread from abolitionist societies, namely the Pennsylvania abolition society. They led to the creation of numerous other societies, but their impact was inconclusive (there wasn't any real quantitative measure to their impact, so I'm wondering how much of an effect they really had).


However, slavery had a hard time in some places due to the fact that many people considered blacks being inferior because of their race, and they wanted to keep them in control. Also appearing in a lot of my sources was the argument that even though some people weren't against slavery, they were against black freedom, and believed that although blacks shouldn't be kept in the oppressive institution, they aren't fit for freedom.


**TLDR for Above:** After doing research, what I gathered is that abolition societies spread the revolutionary anti-slavery sentiment, and slaves weren't as effective in the less-agrarian north to the economy. But some were still against slavery basically because of racism.


Still, the Northern states abolished slavery. My questions are, what effect did the abolition societies actually have, or were they just some network of protesters that didn't actually have a state impact? How effective were their petitions/pleas to their state legislatures? Was abolition/emancipation more from abolitionist sentiment or economic incentive?


EDIT: The TLDR

97,"Today is the Circassian Day of Mourning; 153 years ago, Tsar Aleksandr II declared end of the 101 years long Russo-Circassian war, resulted cleansing (arguably genocide) of Circassians, the indigenous peoples, from their homeland and annexation&amp;destruction of Circassia","With the permission of /u/haveyougoogle, I'm gonna post a tweaked version of his old and short abstract explaining the day.

153 years ago, in 2 June 1864 (21 May 1864 by then Russian calendar), Russian Tsar Aleksandr II declared that the Russo-Circassian War, a series of war that started in 1763 - and lasted approximately 101 years and which was part of the Russian Empire's Caucasus conquest, had ended, and of course the occupation of Circassian land by Russian Empire. By quoting Walter Richmonds, in his description of the final conquest and expulsion of the Circassians in the 1860s, Russian officer Ivan Drozdov says this about the death and destruction that his army brought upon Circassians: ‚ÄúMankind has rarely experienced such disasters and to such extremes, but only horror could have an effect on the hostile mountaineers and drive them from the impenetrable mountain thickets.""

You highly probably haven't even heard of Circassia or a nation called Circassians, aside from them living in Europe or where they were and are living, and that's mostly because of the war and the consequences of the war for the once largest nation of North Caucasus, and one of the oldest national groups of Europe. Nation itself was actually pretty famous, from being the subject of the famous travellers and adventure books to being at the frontpages of the American newspapers, or being pointed by the Karl Marx, or from the fantasies of some Western painters about the pale white sex slaves to some pseudo-racist early anthropological classifications where the term Caucasian is still a reminder of: but just in a glimpse of a century, it turned into some unknown word excluding maybe at some paintings about the Ottoman harems and a type of wood, just as the country was destroyed and the population was decimated, and turned into some small isles in the very ancestral homeland or some national groups of other countries.

At the end of the war, victorious Russia approved Dmitry Milyutin's plan which was about ""not to simply move them so that their land could be settled by productive farmers, but rather that 'eliminating the Circassians was to be an end in itself - to cleanse the land of hostile elements'"". Milyutin became the War Minister then, and seen his plan being implemented. The practice was also about what the general field marshal Aleksandr Bariatinskii was saying, especially after the 1830-1840 period: ‚ÄúWe must assume that we will need to exterminate the mountaineers before they agree to our demands‚Äù.

Whole Circassian population in the historical Circassia was lowered to %5 of what it was by the early 1860s (also it should be noted that, even before the adaption of the Milyutin's plans in Kabarda/Eastern Circassia the population in 1790 which was around 300000 was dropped to 30000 just in 40 years), while during the 101 years long war which Circassians fought against the odds, many were murdered, whole villages were burned and destroyed, corps were destroyed and livestock were killed in order to starve the natives, and regions were surrounded in order to diseases like the plague to kill them all until to point that Russian forces can go in and finish the job (especially in the Kabarda/Eastern Circassia). Only between 1860-1865 at least 625 000 Circassians end up dead, according to both Epifantsev who is with a pro-Russian stance and describes the events as a great crime and inhumane but another chapter of imperial expansionism only, and Richmond who describes events as a genocide. Brutality of the Tsarist commanders were well-known, especially the general Aleksei Ermolov's, while aside from tactics including starving people or annihilating settlements, some figures like General Grigorii Zass furthered things to the point of harvesting Circassian heads and ""the heads of Circassians were constantly stuck on lances on a specially made hill at Prochny Okop, and their beards blew in the wind."" At the end, Circassians were given the choice between resettling to the other side of the river under the Cossack control where they would highly probably die off from the diseases, and left for the Ottoman Empire, while in practice only given option was to leave North Caucasus for the Ottoman Empire (and Iran) and all were driven to the shores of the Black Sea. While hundreds of thousands were forcibly deported, many died before making to the shores and while waiting for the ships where they were forced to shores without food or water by the Imperial Russian forces, and some were even left to the open land without clothing. With the ships arrived, overcrowded ships became tombs for the Circassian who were able to make to them, and a huge portion perished in the Black Sea. Things weren't good for the ones who made to the shores either, where a sizable amount of the survivors died in the places they landed. For example, a diplomat in Trabzon during the period writes ""so far 19000 of the 24700 people who landed to Trabzon has died. 200 of the 110000 refugees around the Samsun region are dying on the daily basis"". While numbers depends on the source, according to many, between 2 to 2.5 millions of Caucasian Mountaineers were expelled, while only around 1.5 million of them made to the shores, and only less than a million of them managed to survive. In 1879, the New York Times called the Circassians ‚Äúa Murdered Nation‚Äù.

Although the Circassians (and Ubykhs who were included in Circassians) and also Abkhazians and Abazas were the main victims, the expulsions also deeply affected other peoples in the Caucasus region. It was estimated that 80% of the Ingush left Ingushetia for the Middle East in 1865. Lowland Chechens as well were evicted in large numbers. The Arshtins were completely wiped out and became a little clan within the neighbouring Chechen nation. Also, small numbers of Muslim Ossetians and Lezgins were expelled as well.

Today 90% of people with Circassian descendent now live in other countries rather than their homeland. The depopulated Circassian lands were resettled by various ethnic groups, including Russians, Ukrainians and Georgians.

In 1990, the Circassians designated the 21st of May as the national Day of Mourning, as the anniversary of the Circassian genocide and exile committed as a part of the colonialist policies of the Tsarist Russia. Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin's May 1994 statement admitted that North Caucasian resistance to the tsarist forces was legitimate, but the current appeal notes that he did not recognize ""the guilt of the tsarist government for the genocide committed against the peoples of the North Caucasus"". Personally, like the vast majority of my nation, while I do count the events as a genocide, and while many Russians do say it was only a war crime, ethnic cleansing, imperial expansion or ""Americans did the same to the Native Americans and they say it isn't a genocide either"", I don't think the terminology is going to differ what has happened at the end. And let me remind that, current Russians are unrelated to these events, Russian Federation is also not responsible nor the legal successor of the Russian Empire. While of course there are some demands, which are about recognition of the crime, restoration of Circassia instead of the ongoing policy of dividing Circassians into some even non-existing subgroups and the shared-republic policies, and the right to repatriate to our ancestral and historical homeland (especially for the ones in the warzones, like Syrian Circassians), there isn't anybody holding current Russia responsible for anything.

For many times, heads of current Circassian Republics under Russian Federation, requested Duma to reconsider the situation request for and apology. But to date, there has been further moves from Russian Federation other than Sochi Olympics at year, also the 150th anniversary of genocide and exile, in the very city, where Circassians had surrendered in 1864. I really don't know why, Russia also chosen to hold skiing and related events and build the core of the Olympic infrastructure in Krasnaya Polyana, which was ""once known as Qbaada"" and ""settled by Russian immigrants and renamed Krasnaya Polyana (Red Meadow), a reference to all the blood spilled on the field during the final battle"". Sure that this wasn't ""cool"" at least, especially while there wasn't any mention of Circassians in the opening or the ending ceremony but more importantly, while Syrian Circassians were not able repatriate to their historical homeland from the brutal warzones.

Note: For the ones who are into the maps, this was Circassia in 1750: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Circassia_in_1750.png

And this is the current demographic map of the North Caucasus: https://eurasiangeopolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/cau-ethnic-groups-4.png

All Adyghe Cherkess and Kabardin are Circassians (Adygean being the term for Western Circassians sometimes excluding Shapsugs and Adyge means Circassian in Circassian, and Kabardin being the largest eastern tribe of Circassians, while Cherkess is also some weird made-up thing and Cherkess means Circassian in Russian). You can also see the remaining population of Abkhazians in once nearly all Abkhazian dominated Abkhazia, who was the other nation who were exiled alongside with Circassians.

1.21: The narrator states the Celts were the ancestors of the Scottish and Irish clans. He also leaves out they were the ancestors of the French, English, Bretons and Welsh, as well as a large proportion of the Spanish and North Italian population. One drink for the overly narrow statement. DRINK!

1.22: The ""stats"" of the Celtic warrior don't mention they would wear maille. DRINK!

1.23: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!

1.27: Metal helmet with nose-guard many centuries before they became common. DRINK!

1.33: Two errors here. First, the narrator calls the Persian Immortal a special-ops killer. Disregarding the fact that the Immortals were most likely called Companions (An√ª≈°iya as opposed to Anau≈°a), the Immortals were an army of full-time troops intended to fight in open battle, not a small group of men who would operate behind enemy lines. Next, the ""stats"" list them as having a wicker shield, as opposed to a wooden shield that a Persian professional unit would usually possess. Wicker shields were employed to form a shield wall, and not for guard duty. DRINK! 

2.40: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!
2.47: MORE HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!

2.52: Time to roll out the ""experts"". The first is Francis Brebner. Extraordinarily fit looking guy and a participant in Highland games, he may have the athletic ability but has no background in martial-arts or experimental archaeology. DRINK!

3.17: The next person is Spencer Dinnean, whom I could find absolutely no information about. DRINK!

3.42: The narrator says the Celts were the first iron-workers in Europe and helped usher in the Iron Age. Uh, no. That would be the Greeks, and the Iron-Age was transmitted from the Middle-East, not heralded by the Celts. DRINK!

3.46: The narrator says that iron helped the Celts conquer much of Europe. Again, no. Celtic culture was spread through a variety of methods. Migration seems to be the most attested to within written sources, but trade and acculturation to a new elite may have also been methods. DRINK!

3.59: The Celtic noble is not wearing maille. DRINK!

4.14: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!

4.51: The first Iranian expert is Ardeshir ""Bitches be nothing next to sharp akinakes"" Radpour. Now we are getting somewhere! Mr Radpor is a trained rider, martial-artist and experimental archaeologist. He is also a metal smith and has crafted numerous weapons and armour. His website can be found here:

http://www.radpour.com/

This has earned The ByzantineBasileus Seal of Approval (tm).

5.02: Mr Radpour called the Immortals special-forces. The ByzantineBasileus Seal of Approval (tm) withdrawn. Also, DRINK!

5.17: The next individual is Cyrus Zahiri, also known as Cyrus James, who appears to be only an actor and occasional film crewmen. DRINK!

5.28: The shape of the shields here is correct, but they are held in the wrong manner. They are held horizontally rather than vertically, meaning the warriors lose the protection offered to their lower and upper bodies. DRINK!

5.59: The Immortals were infantry, and did not use chariots. DRINK!

5.52: The narrator says the Persian scythed chariot would destroy any resistance. Most of the accounts of scythed chariots describe them as total failures when facing troops who were prepared for them. DRINK!

6.09: The narrator states that the Immortals numbered ten thousand. This figure comes from Herodotus, but I personally doubt his description is accurate. I would propose that the ""Immortals"" where a guard unit of 1000 men with golden apples on their spears. The amount of 10,000 should perhaps refer to the standing palace regiments as a whole, who were called the Companions.

6.31: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!

6.46: STILL MORE HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!

7.03: The narrator calls the Celtic sword a long-sword, which was a specific weapon from the medieval period. DRINK!

7.10: Francis Brebner states the Celtic sword had a rounded point whilst holding a version of the weapon with a relatively narrow point. DRINK!

9.05: Francis swings at the armour instead of thrusting under the scales. DRINK!

10.17: Test is done against a bare head, whilst an Immortal would have been most likely been wearing a helmet. DRINK!

11.19: Narrator calls the Immortal a commando. DRINK!

12.15: The narrator says an ancient Celtic warrior would have had a burda, which was a club. I have never read about the burda being used by the ancient Celts, so I will count this as an error. DRINK!

13.19: This test proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that a sharp iron point can penetrate flesh.

14.03: Francis suggest a leather belt as protection for a Celtic warrior rather than, you know, MAILLE! DRINK!

14.28: That belt looks less like a belt and more like a girdle. For when your warrior wants to look svelte on the battlefield!

14.59: I am sure a Celtic warrior would not just let you pull down his shield like that, especially with him holding it and trying to cut you in the spleen. DRINK!

16.48: ANOTHER OCCASION OF HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING!

17.17: MORE SHIELDS HELD INCORRECTLY IN A BATTLE-LINE! DRINK!

17.33: Not only are their shields held inproperly, they wield their spears in a manner that actually prevents them attacking with it! Double drink. DRINK! DRINK!

17.39: Sigh. More Hollywood Dual-Wielding. DRINK!

17.45: ""Coming up! Both sides thrust their most piercing weapons!"". Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.

18.44: Francis states that Celtic spear-heads were wavy in shape. In reality they were leaf-shaped:

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/69/e3/33/69e333085eb3cc9de09c629d1d449339.jpg

DRINK!

19.27: They are testing a Celtic spear by throwing it, rather than using it hand-to-hand. DRINK!

The way I understand it, Aristotle did as much to keep philosophy (&amp; science) back as he did to move it forward. Additionally, some of his *insight* was bunk even at the time. For example, philosophers suspected that light came from sources and bounced off objects and into our eyes, right? But Aristoltle was all like ""no way man, what if rays come out of our eyes and bounce off objects? Far out...""
Didn't they (philosophers) know of the camera obscura effect at the same time? How could any truly intelligent person reconcile the two?

28,"Nathan Bedford Forrest, hero, villain or antihero?","Nathan Bedford Forrest remains one of the most controversial figures in the Civil War. He was born illiterate to a blacksmith, by trading cotton, land and slaves he became a millionaire. But the most impressive thing about him was his martial capabilities. Unlike most planation owners or slave owners he enlisted but remarkably as a private. He was soon promoted to lieutenant colonel. He personally payed for the equipment of his troops. That what started his legend. His combat ability was widespread defeating federal forces 3 times his size. Constantly harassing union supply line. A man which no formal military education out foxing men graduating from West Point and veterans from the Mexican-American war. He was feared by all. However, his most controversial stage came in April, 1864. With him capturing Fort Pillow. While the garrison, whom was defended by a combined force of colored and white troops, refused to surrender even being warned no quarter would be given. Forrest sounded the charge. It was a one sided battle, however, soon after a massacre ensued. With men being shot down begging for mercy. It has been disputed whether or not Forrest did order the massacre. Survivors and troops said yes, Sherman, other troops and Forrest himself said otherwise. After the war, Forrest lost many profits due to slaves being released. He eventually joined the KKK. While he did not found the group, he was selected to be the Grand Wizard, a reference to a nickname of his command during the war. Forrest once again denied involvement with the KKK, saying he sympathized with them but was not a group. However, after a year as Grand Wizard, he quit the KKK. Eventually, he offered to hunt the group down as he saw their actions as too violent. His views on race soon developed with him advocating admitting blacks into law school and co existence between blacks and whites in America. He was eventually denounced by other white supremacist groups for his views. Nathan Bedford Forrest died on October 29th, 1877 at the age of 56 in Memphis, Tennessee. So what are your thoughts?

 For a couple of years I always hear about nazis and the ww2. How nazis were bad and hateful and decided to declare war. But nazis were Germans. And the common army of the common German loved Hitler. I am currently watching world at war, a UK TV serie from the 70's about ww2 and there are plenty of clips or pictures like this [One](http://i.cubeupload.com/4S0x9V.png)

The place is packed with Germans... So why the hell, in almost every documentary or discussion there is, I hear talks about nazis and nobody calls a spade a spade? That the Germans are responsible for choosing Hitler and starting ww2. 

I'm not questioning Hitler 's rise to power nor all the propaganda. However I would like to know why in recent times we are naming the perpetrators Nazis and not Germans. 

Edit. Typo

Edit2. To clarify, I'm just afraid that the younger generation, born post 2000, when learning in schools about ww2 is taught the that nazis started the war and not the Germans. For them the name nazis is  abstract on the same level as elfs in Tolkien 's trilogy. And IMO it is bad because it dehumanize the perpetrator and it is not showing the evil in humans but the evil in some nazis.

23,"If current name didn't stick, how would you call the Byzantine Empire","Practically the first thing any material tells you of the Byzantine Empire is that its current name is not correct, and the empire is actually Roman, and was considered a true Roman Empire by both its inhabitants and neighbouring countries.

With all that in mind for historical reasons the term Byzantine is continued to be used in order to emphasise the cultural and administrative difference between the two periods of the empire. But current term ""Byzantine"" was originally put as derogatory and still holds a bit of negative connotation in it. Moreover, it kinda denies the Roman heritage of Byzantine Empire, as ""Roman"" is nowhere in the title and without a remark addressing population of Byzantium as ""Romans"" may cause confusion. 

All this leads to a question - is there a way to address Byzantine Empire in such way that would a) keep clear that they are a Roman Empire in a period of time, b) make no confusion with the Roman Empire of antiquity or any other state.

The most used alternative name is Eastern Roman Empire, but this term is mostly used for the Late Antiquity period, when Western Empire still existed or, the period soon after, while there was still chance of reconquering. So using this already established term for the late period may also cause some confusion, as it leaves the problem of addressing the populace, would you call them eastern romans all the time? What if you need to specifically mention the population living in the west, like in Greece, would it be western eastern romans? Sounds a bit over complicated.

The most technically correct term could be Romania, as it is how the county was called by its inhabitants, and it distinguishes enough from Roman Empire. But it creates confusion with the modern country of Romania, that has little to do with both Roman and Byzantine Empires. Even if you use alternate writing, like Rhomania, it wont help you much in verbal conversation.

Another way is to use the time period or location, making it Medieval Roman Empire or Anatolian Roman Empire. The second one is a bit of ironical, as in greek it would sound exactly like Eastern Roman Empire, as Anatolia means East in greek.

And the last idea is to use the same logic by which we differentiate Frankia from France or Rus from Russia, - to use the contemporary language variations of the term. As the language used was greek instead of latin, the empire was actually called Basile√≠a Rh≈çma√≠≈çn, basically making it Romai (or Romei/Rhomei etc) Empire and it citizens Romai.

So what would would be a best name for the Roman Empire in the East, if term ""Byzantine"" was to be dropped?

87,Anybody who wants to get a raw firsthand account of the Eastern Front from the Soviet point of view should read Memories of the War by Nikolai Nikulin.,"I""m sorry, I've been on a memoir kick lately and I hope I'm not bothering anybody with this. 

In a lot of the memoirs from former Soviet soldiers, and this may just be because they're the only ones that have been translated from into English, there's plenty of unabashed worship of Stalin and his brutal dictatorship. Don't get me wrong I don't think the men who wrote them are lying per say, but there's defintley an element of ""Yeah, some bad stuff happened on our side but FOR THE MOTHERLAND!"". Which isn't surprising due to the incredible indoctrination these men experienced from childhood to adulthood under the Stalin's regime. They were taught to worship him as infallible and all-caring. 

In addition, though I could be totally off base on this, I have a theory that so many of the atrocities committed by Stalin and the government required, if not the consent, than at least non-resistance on the part of those who survived his many purges, and crackdowns both before, during, and after the war. This might, in the back of their minds, plague them with guilt. But rather than address it they gloss over or worse, justify them. 

Nikolai Nikulin's memoir is different. From what I understand, he didn't even mean for it to be published. It was supposed to be a purging of the past for him. So he could try to make sense of all the violence and chaos he witnessed and took part in. And, so he could gain some peace of mind. Nikulin was only 17 years old when he was drafted into the army from Leningrad and  the things he was dealing with are mind boggling. I'm only thirty or so pages in and I've had to stop a few times just to soak in his words. They're hard and raw, much like the war itself. 

He never attempts to glamorize the crimes of the Nazi's *but* and this is more important, he shed light on the cruelty, violence, and desperation of the Red Army in 1942. Like I said, this isn't a traditional memoir, from the Soviet side. It's dark and incredibly depressing. This is early for me to say, but I think it's maybe the best memoir from the Soviet side that I've read as of yet. It reminds me in many ways of With The Old Breed by Eugene Sledge. Both of them detail the gradual mind numbing insensitivity to violence that the soldiers experience as the war grinds on. 

Forewarning though, this English translation isn't a professional one. the person who did this was an amateur, a talented one, but an amateur nonetheless, and it shows where sentences fumble in a few places or where words are missing. *But*, that also shows how strong this man's words are that I can hear them clearly and vividly from the page, and I can see the picture he's trying to paint in the readers eyes. I *highly* recommend anybody who has even a passing interest in this subject take a look at the link to the pdf of the translation I'll provide. I don't know if anybody read my rant but if you did, thanks! And I hope you take the time to read and ""enjoy"" it. Insomuch that any person can enjoy a book like this.....

31,"For Earth Day 2017 - Pliny The Elder's Natural History (*Naturalis Historia*): ""The Nature of the Earth""","CHAP. 63. (63.)‚ÄîNATURE OF THE EARTH.
Next comes the earth, on which alone of all parts of nature we have bestowed the name that implies maternal veneration. It is appropriated to man as the heavens are to God. She receives us at our birth, nourishes us when born, and ever afterwards supports us; lastly, embracing us in her bosom when we are rejected by the rest of nature, she then covers us with especial tenderness; rendered sacred to us, inasmuch as she renders us sacred, bearing our monuments and titles, continuing our names, and extending our memory, in opposition to the shortness of life. In our anger we imprecate her on those who are now no more, as if we were ignorant that she is the only being who can never be angry with man. The water passes into showers, is concreted into hail, swells into rivers, is precipitated in torrents; the air is condensed into clouds, rages in squalls; but the earth, kind, mild, and indulgent as she is, and always ministering to the wants of mortals, how many things do we compel her to produce spontaneously! What odours and flowers, nutritive juices, forms and colours! With what good faith does she render back all that has been entrusted to her! It is the vital spirit which must bear the blame of producing noxious animals; for the earth is constrained to receive the seeds of them, and to support them when they are produced. The fault lies in the evil nature which generates them. The earth will no longer harbour a serpent after it has attacked any one, and thus she even demands punishment in the name of those who are indifferent about it themselves. She pours forth a profusion of medicinal plants, and is always producing something for the use of man. We may even suppose, that it is out of compassion to us that she has ordained certain substances to be poisonous, in order that when we are weary of life, hunger, a mode of death the most foreign to the kind disposition of the earth, might not consume us by a slow decay, that precipices might not lacerate our mangled bodies, that the unseemly punishment of the halter may not torture us, by stopping the breath of one who seeks his own destruction, or that we may not seek our death in the ocean, and become food for our graves, or that our bodies may not be gashed by steel. On this account it is that nature has produced a substance which is very easily taken, and by which life is extinguished, the body remaining undefiled and retaining all its blood, and only causing a degree of thirst. And when it is destroyed by this means, neither bird nor beast will touch the body, but he who has perished by his own hands is reserved for the earth.  
  
But it must be acknowledged, that everything which the earth has produced, as a remedy for our evils, we have converted into the poison of our lives. For do we not use iron, which we cannot do without, for this purpose? But although this cause of mischief has been produced, we ought not to complain; we ought not to be ungrateful to this one part of nature5. How many luxuries and how many insults does she not bear for us! She is cast into the sea, and, in order that we may introduce seas into her bosom, she is washed away by the waves. She is continually tortured for her iron, her timber, stone, fire, corn, and is even much more subservient to our luxuries than to our mere support. What indeed she endures on her surface might be tolerated, but we penetrate also into her bowels, digging out the veins of gold and silver, and the ores of copper and lead; we also search for gems and certain small pebbles, driving our trenches to a great depth. We tear out her entrails in order to extract the gems with which we may load our fingers. How many hands are worn down that one little joint may be ornamented! If the infernal regions really existed, certainly these burrows of avarice and luxury would have penetrated into them. And truly we wonder that this same earth should have produced anything noxious! But, I suppose, the savage beasts protect her and keep off our sacrilegious hands. For do we not dig among serpents and handle poisonous plants along with those veins of gold? But the Goddess shows herself more propitious to us, inasmuch as all this wealth ends in crimes, slaughter, and war, and that, while we drench her with our blood, we cover her with unburied bones; and being covered with these and her anger being thus appeased, she conceals the crimes of mortals.

39,Why Did Most German Americans Settle in the Midwest?,"The demographics of the US have always fascinated me. I am originally from small town in New Jersey where Irish, Italian and English (with some Scottish and Welsh) were the most common nationalities by far. 

I always assumed Irish or English was the most common nationality but was surprised to find out it is German. Largely due to the midwest being overwhelmingly German.

The Eastcoast as a whole has a large English, Scottish and Welsh population because the Eastcoast minus Florida were the original 13 Colonies of the US. 

The Northeast has a large Irish and Italian population since they came over in large numbers to Boston and NYC. Both of these cultures have a strong enclave mentality and liked to stick together. So even when they began leaving NYC and Boston to move to the rural Northeast, they still did it in groups. 

The South received little immigration and is overwhelmingly English, Scottish and Welsh. (Though Dale Earnhardt had German ancestry and a German surname). 

Now why did the Germans largely go to the Midwest? I know PA has a large German population but they are really the only Northeast State to have one. There are small pockets of German Americans in New York, New Jersey and New England but they are usually a minority. 

Did the Italians and Irish not like the Germans so they forced them out with organized crime? Aka told them to ""Get da fuck outta here, you kraut bastard!""

Or was it more for economic reasons? Perhaps farms in the midwest needed farmhards and the Germans went there for work. (I know many Germans came to America for economic reasons).",history,1492271441,NYRangers1313,166,425,True,2017-04-15

49,Churchill: A Biography by Roy Jenkins,"I've just completed all 912 pages of Roy Jenkins' biography of Winston Churchill. A fine piece of work, as I expected from Roy Jenkins, whose other biography of Gladstone I have also had the pleasure of reading. As a man who himself spent much of his life at the centre of British politics, Jenkins clearly has a sympathy and an understanding of Churchill that no other historian would be able to have. But he is also critical of Churchill when he feels that criticism is merited, and is not afraid to point out his embarrassing failures, such as the Dardanelles disaster of 1915, or his hare-brained attempt to reverse the movement towards Indian self-rule in the 1930s, which came close to derailing the fight against appeasement.

We begin with Churchill as a young man, deprived of attention from both his parents and forced to seek out himself and his talents. His adventures in the Sudan, in India and in South Africa, his daring escape from Boer captivity, his subsequent election as an MP for Oldham, his change of party and his subsequent entry into Asquith's cabinet are all faithfully recorded. Jenkins is liberal in his use of sources, drawing heavily on diary accounts, particularly those of Asquith's daughter Violet. We see Churchill rise to become a senior member of the Asquith regime, his partnership with the radical Lloyd-George, his becoming First Lord of the Admiralty and helping to prepare the navy for the First World War, his subsequent fall from grace after the Dardanelles disaster, his journey to the front, his return and subsequent redemption under Lloyd-George, his post-war rise to the Chancellorship, resignation over India, wilderness years and then his triumphant ascension to supreme power in 1940, leading Britain to victory over the forces of Nazi Germany.

Churchill's evening years are depressing, but flashes of lucidity and brilliance can be discerned. His second premiership in the 1950s is fairly mediocre, and Jenkins' description of his death in the concluding pages is almost anti-climactic, consisting of little more than a few paragraphs.",history,1492278851,TheCarlyleanHero,1,2,True,2017-04-15

Basically as far as I know, it has pretty much a 100% accurate depiction of Shingens' army during 16th century, all soldiers, cooks, equipment, supplies etc. etc.

I tried to find more information about it and I'm still looking, but for all I know now, it looks to me like it's some old dusty book held in some kind of giant glass box where no one is permitted to enter.

Now the odds are seriously stacked against him, but he manages to do it, and yet he struggles to fight single opponents (even if they were trained, I can see it being the same level as those four with REAL weapons and armour in his first battle), and then him and crixus, two people, are required to take down a single person, the cloud of death guy or whatever his name was.

32,Question: has anyone here successfully obtained research material via a FOIA request?,"I wrote the FBI over 3 years ago with my FOIA, concerning a book about historical events in the US, from decades ago; the FBI was involved to an extent, and I assumed they might have useful material. (Additionally, as I'm not from the US, I can't, unfortunately, go around libraries to access microfiche files, etc., as part of the research, and an institution with such a vast catalogue of data available seemed worth a try).

In 2015, I received a letter from the FBI. It turned out that they did indeed have files that would be extremely useful for the book: in fact, there were many hundreds of pages and even multimedia that would be of great help.

I confirmed that I was very much interested in the files, and confirmed that the cost of duplicating would be fine. I sent the reply via a letter, not an e-mail - and, well, I've been waiting ever since. Last year, I e-mailed the FBI, asking if there was any way to know what the request's status was, but all I could find out was the automatic request status check on the fbi.gov site.

And since then, for almost 2 years now, my request's status has been: ""The FBI's FOIPA Program has identified potential responsive information to your request(s) and awaits assignment to a Government Information Specialist (GIS) for further processing.""

Obviously I know that there are many pages to copy in my request. I understand how swamped with FOIA requests they are, and how many are infuriatingly long to process, trivial, etc... but if you've had experience with successful FOIA requests, what did you do? Did you keep getting in touch, reminding of your existence, so to say - or even pestering them with ""I'm still waiting"" notes? (Something I'd prefer to avoid doing :)

In a nutshell, if you received your material, how long did you have to wait... and did you accelerate your request somehow?

Should I contact them again, via e-mail, via letters? Via phone or fax, perhaps? Or should I just keep checking the status page, wait patiently, and hope?

2.  The military still was handing out medals. The scene in the subway tunnels where their was a military man handing out medals to the soldiers. What did the soldiers think of this as it was collapsing about them?

3.  I did some digging on the Internet as well and although the fronts were collapsing Germany still was transporting people to the death camps.

The 5RTR used a variety of (predominantly UK) machines throughout the war from A9/13s to (US supplied) Grants/Shermans and later on Churchills etc (supported by Sherman-fireflies), **so I wondered if UK tanks had a lower survivability than the Sherman?**

The wikipedia article for 'military dictatorship' makes no mention of any state older than the 19th century, but to my mind, every state in Europe before the adoption of constitutions and the Republican revolutions of the 19th-20th centuries were military dictatorships - the king was a warleader and he ruled his country by force of arms.

How can things change just with a single person's word for it? Also, in light of what is the history of China, does revolution (done in the good way, but what really is the good way...?) really do things for the people and the country or is it the selfish ways of the leadership?

first off, I hope this is the right subreddit for this.
I contemplated where to put this, but as it's neither historical photographs or a blog or something else, I think it fits best here.

Now, onto the topic:

I live in Germany, in an area called Niederrhein (or Lower Rhine Area), and while there's not really that much that is interesting, the Archeological Park Xanten (APX) certainly is.
It is the excavation and reconstruction side of the ancient roman Colonia Ulpia Traiana and the adjacent legionary camps Vetera I and II.

As there are so many people on Reddit who probably will never visit the park, as they simply can't travel this far just to visit an archeological park, I decided to make use of the excellent weather yesterday and take some shots of the most important or interesting things there.

In the end, I had over 300 pictures, and from those I chose 86 that I uploaded in different imgur album.

I hope you enjoy what I did and if there's interest, I could upload the rest of the pictures as a .zip file. I tried to capture the explanations most of the time as well, so I think they might be interesting even without any comments.
I also took some videos, but didn't upload them so far as I wanted to see whether there's interest at all.

So, that said, I hope you enjoy the pictures and if there are any questions, feel free to ask, I'll try to answer them as best as I can. I might also do another visit if people tell me what they want to see more of.

The guide pointed out that while most of world history is written about rich, successful people and momentous events, The Rocks was a relatively rare glimpse into what conditions probably would have been like for me had I lived back then.

Can anyone recommend something that would describe what a ""normal"" persons life was like in ancient Rome?  I'm looking for something describing the customs, morals, sexuality (views on monogamy, pair bonding, marriage and divorce for example), family makeup, familial (spousal and parental) and neighborly relations, etc.  What kind of things would a child get in trouble for doing at the dinner table?  How did families relate to one another and their community?  What would a community put up with?  What would they punish?  What would they celebrate?  How did they see death and handle funerals?

I can pretty much imagine what life in a hovel is like (dark, cold, stinky), I'm looking for more of a holistic view though.  These people had lives, customs, and relationships, and they made the best of them they could.  What was that like?

I found these books on my mum's bookshelf whilst visiting my parents in London. I thought you guys would appreciate them - they give a fascinating insight into the views of the time regarding the geo political situation in Europe, the build up to war, and the UK's war effot. Reading them, you really get a sense of the fear and confusion that must have been prevalent at the time. The books are: 

&amp;nspb;

1) **""What Hitler Wants""** by E. O. Lorimer  (published 1939)

The author discusses the strategic aims of Hitler as set out by himself in *""Mein Kampf""* within the context of the recent end of the Sudetanland Crises. A very interesting book as  *""Mein Kampf""* had not been widely circulated in languages other than German.

&amp;nbsp;

The author dedicates the book: *"" In Sorrow and Mourning to the memory of The Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia - whose heroism, steadfastness, and self restraint during the dark days of September 1938 have won her people a fame as imperishable as the infamy of her foes and three humiliation of her friends""*

&amp;nbsp;

2) **""Why Britain is At War""** by Harold Nicholson (Published 1939)

The author discusses the geo political facts that lead up to Britain's recent declaration of war against Germany.

&amp;nbsp;

3) **""Must the War Spread""** by D. N. Print, K.C., M.P. (published January 1940)

The author talks of his fears that the capitalists nations of the world are planning to declare war on the Soviet Union in order to contain the threat of socialism. 

&amp;nbsp;


4) **""Hitler's War - Before and After""** by Hugh Dalton M.P. (Published March 1940)

The author discusses the causes of the second world war and his views of what the settlement should be after it. He talks of his hope to see free and independent Poland and Czechoslovakia restored.

&amp;nbsp;

5) **""Planning the War""** by Lt. Col. Garsia (published June 1941)

The author argues that the chief problem faced by the UK at that stage in the conflict is the government's failure to plan effectively and properly utilise the vast resources of the British Empire",history,1489839841,kawheye,1,4,True,2017-03-18

I remember reading a quotation about how the historical evidence we have today constitutes just a tiny amount of all the literature and material culture that the civilisation that evidence is about produced while it was around, but I can't remember what the quote was.

It's quoted in a book called ""The methods and skills of history: a practical guide (Michael J. Salevouris; Conal Furay)"", but I don't have the book on hand to check what it said exactly. It accompanied a diagram with a little black circle in the middle, representing the evidence used in a historian's book, inside a larger circle which represented the evidence available for a historian to draw on, inside a larger circle which represented all the evidence that survived to that particular date or something like that, inside a larger circle of etc. etc. etc. The quote was based on a similar structure, I believe.

77,When does a revolution end and when does it begin?,"I am in a college course on revolutions in Latin America.  I am currently writing a paper that got me thinking about how large or small a movement needs to be in order to be considered a revolution.  It is very important to note that by revolution I do not mean an independence movement.  By revolution I mean a movement/act/war/individual that alters the social and economic status quo of society for the long term.

This caused me to think of the US and potential revolutions within its history.  I would not consider the American War of Independence from Great Britain to be a revolution, just an independence movement, because society stayed pretty much the same post war.  There were still slaves, the economy stayed the same, elites stayed in power, the indigenous population had no change in status and the day to day lives of society as a whole did not alter enough to consider the American War of Independence a revolution (again, this is just my thesis on the topic).  I would consider the American Civil War a revolution though because the social and economic status quo of the United States changed with slaves becoming ""free"" and farmers having to move to sharecropping (practical slavery) over literal slavery.

But I began thinking about the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s and was wondering if that could be considered a revolution because a segment of the population was able to alter their status as people and society was forced to change its makeup and way of everyday life.  This can be seen especially with integration of schools and the abandonment of the separate but equal clause, along with the obvious Civil Rights legislation.  

I began wondering if the American Civil War was just the beginning of a revolution which was finally completed once Civil Rights were achieved, or if the two are completely separate revolutions.  Or even if the Civil Rights movement can/should be considered a revolution at all.  So what are your thoughts on this concept of a revolution?  Is the Civil Rights movement a continuation of the same Civil War revolution or are they completely separate?  Or would you not consider the Civil Rights movement a revolution at all?

Before this, much trade was conducted through the Middle East, though after the Islamic conquest of Constantinople (now Istanbul), the trade was cut off and Europeans began searching alternative methods, such as by ship.

Individuals risked their lives for profit, though the leadership really just wanted trade. The main problem is that many kingdoms, including Imperial China, were only interested in gold and silver to fill their treasuries, and neglected to study European learning. This made them more and more behind during the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, which left them militarily weak and unable to challenge the growing might of the European trading posts, as well as enforcing order such as stopping the import of opium.",history,1488603025,Sparkykun,12,6,True,2017-03-03

Whose job was it to remove the charred bodies from burned out tanks, and how did they then move the tanks (and where did they take them?)

Who removed the debris from the thousands of crash sites resulting from the relentless allied bombing of Europe? 

Any info or firsthand accounts would be very welcome, and much appreciated, as this is the side of war we're not used to hearing about.",history,1488613914,HansCrotchfelt,442,1571,True,2017-03-04

   The same applies to Norwegian for example where the numbers 1 to 10 sound more or less the same as the Latin and Irish ones. I found it surprising as from the little knowledge I have, the Latin countries didn't have ties with Ireland when Gaelic Irish was spoken and even less with Scandinavia.

Two adjacent German armies had failed to protect a vital north-south road and its bridge, and the British 11th Armoured Division was able to both take it and drive forces across, occupying hills to the south.

German forces intended to counterattack Operation Cobra were drawn into this battle, notably the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, and intense fighting raged for a week before the Germans fell on the defensive, trying to hold off the Allied forces to allow their army in Normandy to escape back to the Seine River.",history,1488680087,llordlloyd,174,3873,True,2017-03-04

_____________________________________________________________________________________


Now on to the game itself...

**Playing the Game:**

The aim of the game is to figure out the answer by identifying the picture. Then you get to leave your answer in the comments. If your answer is correct, you will be messaged the instructions to start a new round - you win, you post!
Furthermore, with every win you get, your flair is updated along with your leaderboard entry.


_____________________________________________________________________________________


**Theme Day (the cause for this crosspost):**

Every week on Saturday we will host a Theme Day, where we encourage all rounds to conform to a particular theme

* for example, 'Movies' or 'Old-school Videogames'. These themes are voted by the users every month (the highest voted suggestions are used throughout the month).
* This week's theme is Ancient Civs, so we'll need some of you History experts to provide your input and trump most of our players with your vast knowledge!
* Theme Day ends at midnight EDT (UTC -5) (the start of Sunday), but you can feel free to continue posting history related rounds if you like, whenever you like.

_____________________________________________________________________________________



**Must-Reads for Newer Players:**

* The Beginner's Guide: I went over some of this earlier, but it's still worth looking over for more detailed explanations on things like the PictureGame etiquette.
* The Hosting Guide: This is a must-read for players who have never hosted rounds before.
* The Complete Rules: There is a brief summation of the rules of play on the sidebar of /r/PictureGame, but all players must be aware of the complete rules.
The Image Masking Tutorial by /u/fatwoof: This is essential for preventing the deadly force of reverse-image search, which has been known to make rounds with potential of being difficult entirely too easy. Don't fall victim to RIS. Use the tutorial.

97,What do we know about the City of Ys. Sources for a non-revised (or least revised) historically-coherent version of the myth.,"Hi there!

I am no historian, but simply a Celt, found of tales, and adventures strange and rare. However, I don't like excessive addition/revisions, and enjoy when only a few metaphorical elements embellish the historical facts.

There is a tale that I cherish: the myth of the City of Ys. I've read several versions of the myth, and clearly tend to prefer the non-christianised versions (where the soldier/adventurer/lover/... to come is depicted as the devil, and the main roles are given to St Gwenole and God). Without denying the rising Christianization of the Celts at that time, I much prefer the versions depicting the ""generational and religious clash/differences"" between Graalon and Ah√®s as one element of the story more than the only reason for everything to happen.

So I need your help for a set of questions that would help me greatly to have a better picture of what might have happened at that time.

* What do we know about Graalon, his motivation for raiding the nordic shores, his reputation in and outside (continental) Cornwall/Cornouailles?

* What do we know about the Redhead Witch/Ice sorceress/Queen in the North/... that I call Malgwen.

* What do we know about Celtic cities built so close to the wave that they built gates or anything to protect them from the ocean.

* What do we know about specifics events of the narrative: Graalon left alone on Nordic shores, the destruction of the city, celtic feasts, ...

* Lastly, any relevant information about IVe-Ve century Celtic life is more than welcome if it can hep distinguish credible versions from revisions.



NB: I'm a scientist, so references are more than welcome! ;)


In advance, thanks a lot for helping me put some actual History in that :)

Many have tried to convert the Indians. The Muslim Mughal empire ruled over India for 300 years, and even before it there was the Muslim Delhi sultanate. And after the Mughals, the British empire ruled over India, with many Missionaries such as Mother Teresa trying to Convert the Indians to Christianity.

7,My grandpa was one of Lee Harvey Oswald's first victim.,"I thought this was mildly interesting and figured I'd share it. My grandfather has a scar on the top of his head and he always loved to tell us the story behind it. I haven't heard the story in a minute, so I might be a little hazy on the details. But, my grandfather grew up in New Orleans during the '50s apparently he went to school with Lee Harvey Oswalt and was in the same grade as one of his brothers. I think it was one of his younger brothers. He said they used to always give his brother crap and tease him. He told us one day in particular he and Lee Harvey's brother got to brawling. He said he did a number on his brother.  The next day after school while he was walking home apparently Lee Harvey decided to get revenge and attack my grandfather with a broom. He said they fought a little until Harvey hit him upside the head with the broom splintering some of the wood in his head. 

He claims to still have the wood in his head. So anytime anybody says ""knock on wood"" he always offers his head then goes into the story. How true the story is? I'm not completely sure, but, I still like to believe it. ",history,1486190233,Stealyosweetroll,6,10,True,2017-02-04

57,Jacques De Molay - Last Grand Master of The Knights Templars: Betrayer or Martyr?,"Good day everyone,

I wanted to write this brief piece on Jacques De Molay in hopes to create a discussion about his actions in his final days. I also want to bring attention to a BRILLIANT book that I have read multiple times called Born In Blood by John J Robinson. Its IMO one of the greatest and most capturing books I have ever read. I will included a few links pertaining to Grand Master DeMolay at the end.


Jacques De Molay was elected Grand Master some time in the fall/winter of 1292 after Grand Master Gaudin was killed in a battle at Cyprus. Spring 1293 DeMolay made his intentions clear he would do all he could to improve and rebuild the Templar forces.

King Philip IV of France at the time was owed the Templars a huge amount of money, so the king tried to combine the Templars with the Knights of Malta thus making him War King. however, the pope who was not French fought him on this and tried to have King Philip Excommunicated. Demolay also refused to merge with the Templars because they would have to give up a lot of gold and properties. 

King Philip concocted a devious plan to install a French Pope and get rid of the Templars which would allow him to steal all the gold and properties they owned plus he wouldn't have to pay them the money he owed them.

Enter Pope Clement V the French pope King Philip had wanted. Clement V was really known to be soft-willed and easily bullied. King Philip had Clement V declare that the Templars were blasphemers, witch's and homosexuals. The cunning king had to wait for the perfect time to hatch his plan so he waited until his cousins wedding who just happened to be friends with Jacques De Molay.  

Rumors spread of the kings plan but Jacques De Molay couldn't or refused to believe that his friend the king would do that. So De Molay and his top aides entered Paris Oct 12th,1307. The wedding taking place the next day.

Friday the 13th October 1307(this is why Friday the 13th is consider bad or unlucky) Pope Clement V and King Philip IV sent out their Decree and had De Molay and his Templars arrested. Many Templars were able to escape but all thru France the majority were caught.

Demolay and his men were tortured for years and when the king threaten to kill all his men unless they confessed to homosexual acts and witchcraft the y would be killed. So Demolay confessed and admitted to everything under the condition that his Templars were set free and no longer hunted. Of course after he confessed they started killing the Templars, So Demolay publicly recanted and ask for forgiveness about lying and saying his Comrades were homosexuals and Blasphemers. 

Jacques De Molay was Burned at the stake on March 18th 1314 his final words are rumored to be asking for forgiveness not for the acts they were charged with but for betraying the order and his faith in order to protect his own life.

So did Jacques really betray his comrades or did he do the right thing by saving his own life and at the end making everything right? give me your thoughts and opinions!

I apologize for the way this is written so here are some links that may help you better understand the whole story. Also check out the book Born in Blood.. it truly is an amazing read

18,Some restructuring of our existing rules &amp; guidelines.,"Hello everyone!

Just a small announcement today, we just finished restructuring our current rules in the sidebar. Not much changed as we mostly combined some rules and split others of in more explicit rules on their own. 

The aim of these changes are to clarify some rules that sometimes cause confusion and to put more emphasis on some rules that sometimes are overlooked. 

For those really curious and that want to compare them, [here is a side by side comparison](http://i.imgur.com/GUq8bok.png). Below you'll find our current rules. As before we also have a wiki page on which we explain our rules and guidelines a bit more. [You can find that wiki page here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index)

2. **No current politics or soapboxing.**  
 Submissions &amp; comments that are overtly political or that attract too much political discussion will be removed; political topics are only acceptable if discussed in a historical context. Comments should discuss a historical topic, not advocate an agenda. 
 This is entirely at the moderators' discretion and violators will be fed to the bear.
3. **No posts asking for misunderstood or misrepresented history**. This because they have proven to be magnets for comments about discredited fringe theories, false narratives, and disingenuous revisionism. 
4. **Comments should be on-topic** and contribute to the conversation in a meaningful way.
5. **Submissions are limited to events greater than 20 years ago**, submission about more recent events will be removed.
6. **Post in the right subreddit.**

47,Why history is important - a Love letter to history.,"Hey guys,

So I know that while doing history, it is hard to think about what history actually is. One gets all up in details, in systemic analysis and in great continuities or actual, deep changes that forever set humanity on a different path. There is something to be said for a rational approach, for scientific curiosity, for staying cool and trying to understand why the world is the way it is right now.

However, as I have come to realize, history is much more than just that. It is more than just analysis, it is more than just a rational look on what once was.

History is something that the people that lived it, never realized. Nobody knew that they were living in a certain period. So history is more than just an amalgamation of epochs, it is a look back on how humans lived. What deeply moved the humans that came before us. What they hoped, what they feared, what made their life. History is more than just a rational, objective approach, as it is done by and about humans. It's not history of the earth we're looking at, the universe, some unliving materials floating in space without purpose. This is the history of the struggle, of the fights, of the failures and great achievements of humanity, more than the sum of its parts.

Therefore, history is not objective, it's really a story of those who came before us, and therefore it's subjective.

History connects us with what once was and gives us the opportunity to shape what's to come. It is more than that, it's almost like a mirror, where humankind can see what it is capable of, good or bad. It includes horrors that are hard to comprehend, but also the will to live on, to fight and survive and make the next day a better one. There is something to be said for looking in a picture of somebody else and then be able to see yourself in that. 

Some things must never be forgotten for all the victims and lifes it has claimed. Some wars must never be forgotten, for some sacrifices where to great for us to ignore. But it's not all doom and gloom, some achievements must not be forgotten, as they have bettered our lifes forever.

I know, this seems random, but this is what I love about history. It's human by definition, and there is almost no better way to understand yourself than through history. This is what I love about history, and I thought I'd shared it with like-minded people.

Maybe you can tell me what you personally love about history so much?",history,1485621303,Pyrashark,7,19,True,2017-01-28

1. Was the successful German invasion ever in realm of possibility, in either first or second world war - considering all other enemies have been successfully defeated? Also, without use of any nuclear weapons from either side.

59,Why did Germany get blamed for WW1?,"I know that Serbian nationalists assassinated Franz Ferdinand which caused a problem for Austria-Hungary. Then Austria sent Serbia a list of (10?) demands to avoid war, which were completely ridiculous and unacceptable. Serbia then denied and Austria declared war. That made Russia declare war on Austria which in turn made Germany declare war on France which also put Germany at war with Britain. If Germany never declared war on France, wouldn't France have declared war on Germany anyway to take back Alsace-Lorraine?

I know Germany caused escalation in the war but it seems to me that the entire war could've been avoided if Austria had sent more reasonable demands to Serbia. In my opinion it is Austria-Hungary that should've been hit with the sanctions and demilitarization. 

So, again my question is why was Germany blamed for WW1? Also feel free to correct some of what I listed above I feel I may be mistaken as to the reason why Russia joined the war.",history,1485628700,TheCicc,15,6,True,2017-01-28

47,An interesting story I've discovered about an Armenian man from Turkey.,"An interesting story I've discovered about an Armenian man from Turkey. 

In the 1930's an Armenian doctor called Aram Peshtemaljiyan decides to emigrate to Germany and opens a carpet shop in Berlin. (Peshtemal is the cloth wrap men wear in hammams, so there's a whole story in his name alone) 

Then the second World War starts and finally the Red Army shows up and orders all Berliners to keep their homes and shops open to Red Army soldiers for revenge looting and rape. 

So the Peshtemaljiyan family huddle in a corner of the shop as the Soviet troops carry off their merchandise. Then one of the Soviet Asian-looking soldiers comes over and reaches for Aram's daughter and Aram instinctively grabs his hand trying to protect her. The soldier immediately pulls out his pistol and puts it against Aram's head and that's when Aram utters what he thinks are his last words, in Turkish: ""Now we've eaten shit."" (Simdi boku yedik: We're fucked now). 

The Soviet soldier is suddenly confused and responds with: ""Ne dedung? Ne dedung?..."" ('what did you say' in Kyrgyz) to which Aram repeats: ""Simdi boku yedik?"" 

Suddenly the Soviet Soldier becomes overjoyed and cries out ""You are my blood brother"" (""Miz gan garda≈üiz, min sinig garda≈ümam"") in Kyrgiz Turkic and all the rest of the looting party, also from Kyrgyzstan, apologize and hug the Armenians, eventually they talked with some tea and two of the soldiers offered to guard their shop against other Soviet looters. 

After that, Aram has a hattat (Arabic calligrapher) in Istanbul design a calligraphy for his store, which he frames and hangs up. In Muslim stores such a calligraphy would usually read ""bismillahirahmanirahim""(""In the name of God, most Gracious, most Compassionate"").

Aram his one reads ""Now we've eaten sh*t.""

Countries that would have the most legitimacy IMHO :

- Russia (The third Rome)
- Italy 
- Greece (Megali idea...)/ The ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople
- The Holy See

Countries that could have a claim : 

- France (the continuation of West Francia and the heirs of Charlemagne, and later Napoleon)
- Romania
- Turkey (a bit of a stretch as it is already the successor state to the Ottoman Empire, but as Mehmed II called himself a ""Caesar of Rome"" it could make some sense) 
- Germany/Austria (maybe slightly more legitimate than Turkey as they are the successor states of the Holy Roman Empire)
- Some Balkan states (Serbia, Bulgaria...)
- The United Kingdom (Some British kings referring themselves as ""Caesars"")

Isabel talks about riding her bike through bandit area in Sichuan and attacks between Tibetan people, communist soilders and the role of missionaries.

What are your thoughts on this particular piece? Is it more likely that U.S. Gov't. *actually* handed out tons of infected blankets, or that the disease was spread through the westward expansion of the new nation? 

I'm personally unconvinced that such a thing happened. I'm well aware of letters written suggesting such, but there seems to be a lack of evidence proving it did. Am I missing something?

What I need help with is thinking of some progressives (could be a person or an institution) with less of a 'liberal' label in domestic politics for sake of parity. 

So far my examples include Barak Obama (healthcare), Bernie Sanders (wealth inequity), Carrie Fisher (mental health advocate) and the Human Rights Campaign (LGBTQ rights). Needless to say, I think my own political views are clouding my view of who modern progressives are. The more I think about it, guys like Teddy Roosevelt (often lauded as a progressive) were, at least in more modern terms, quite conservative and expressed views that were all but progressive.

90,The Gurkha Warrior,"

&gt;Of the three explanations for the differences between martial and non-martial races in India--climatic theories, physical qualitites, and behavioral characteristics--physical measurement or anthropometry gained the greatest favor [...]

&gt;Physical measurement formed a crucial element in the recruitment of the martial races. The chief measurements taken at the recruiting centers were height and chest width. Although RIsely's methods of measuring skull and nose were not followed, the recruiting handbooks were full of descriptions about these and other physical characteristics of the respective martial classes. The officer who complied the famous handbook, The Goorkhas, noted with pride that their ""physique, compact and sturdy build, powerful development, keen sight, acute hearing, and hereditary education as a sportsman, eminently capacitate him for the duties of a light infantry soldier."" Handbooks went into great detail about distinctive physical characteristics of each of the martial races.

&gt;Another officer/author of an equally famous handbook, The Sikhs, wrote: ""The SIkhs have always been famous for their fine physique and are surpassed by no race in India for high-bred looks, smartness, and soldierly bearing. The lenght of limb makes them excellent marchers, and their physical activity is developed by active habits."" Another handbook, Jats and Gujars, showered similar prasie on the fine physique of the Jat. InThe Dogras, two authors conceded that ""for vigour and manly strength the Dogra is not equal to the SIkh or Jat,"" but added that ""when enlisted, however, they rapidly develop and fill out"" and commended the Dogras as decidedly ""a good looking race,"" being generally ""fair owing to the temperate climate in which they live, and among the higher castes, owing to the purity of their descent."" Using Risley's anthropometric methodology, the authors continued: ""This is a specialty notable among the Brahmins and Rajputs, who are more refined in their appearance than the 'Rathis' and 'Firthis'. The clear, narrow arched eyebrows are a distcintive characteristic of the high-bread Rajput Dogra, as is the fine nose and norrow nostril"".

Gurkha warriors were recruited for their Mongoloid physique, the rest were chosen because they matched European beauty standards.

Sikh armies recruited Gurkha mercenaries who were involved in the most dangerous missions.

Also, Jats were slaughtered by the superior Mongoloid Turkic and Mongolian men under Timur.

&gt;On the 8th of the month I marched from Ahruni, through the jungle to a village called Tohana. In answer to the inquiries I made about the inhabitants, I learned that they were a robust race, and were called Jats. They were Musulmans only in name and had not their equals in theft and highway robbery. They plundered caravans upon the road, and were a terror to Musulmans and travelers. They had now abandoned the village and had fled to the sugar-cane fields, the [p. 45] valleys, and the jungles.2 When these facts reached my ears I prepared a force which I placed under the direction of Tokal Bahadur, son of the Hindu Karkarra,3 and sent it against the Jats. They accordingly marched into the sugar-canes and jungles. I also sent Maulana Nasiru-d din in pursuit of them. When these forces overtook the Jats they put 200 to the sword and made the rest prisoners. A large stock of cattle was captured, and my soldiers returned to camp.

&gt;It was again brought to my knowledge that these turbulent Jats were as numerous as ants or locusts, and that no, traveler or merchant passed unscathed from their hands. They had now taken flight, and had gone into jungles and deserts hard to penetrate. A few of them had been killed, but it was my fixed determination to clear from thieves and robbers every country that I subdued, so that the servants of God, and Musulmans and travellers might be secure from their violence. My great object in invading Hindustan had been to wage a religious war against the infidel Hindus, and it now appeared to me that it was necessary for me to put down these Jats and to deliver travelers from their hands. I consequently placed the care of the baggage and of all the plunder which had been gained in my victories in charge of Amir Sulaiman Shah, to convey it with the heavy baggage to the town of Samana.

&gt;On the 9th of the month I despatched the baggage from Tohana, and on the same day I marched into the jungles and wilds, and slew 2,000 demon-like Jats. I made their wives and children captives, and plundered their cattle and property. Thus I delivered the country from the terror it had long suffered at the hands of the marauding Jats. On the same day a party of saiyids, who [p. 46] dwelt in the vicinity, came with courtesy and humility to wait upon me, and were very graciously received. In my reverence for the race of the prophet, I treated their chiefs with great honour. I gave them all valuable robes, and I appointed an officer to go to their abodes and protect them, so that none of my soldiers should do them any injury.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade_of_Gurkhas

&gt;Today, over 2000 Gurkhas are recruited by the British Army for the Gurkha Contingent of the Singapore Police Force. Approximately 2,000 Gurkhas serve a similar role in the Gurkha Reserve Unit in Brunei.[13] In addition to the British Army, Gurkhas are also recruited by the Indian Army (approximately 100,000 in 44 battalions plus 25 battalions of Assam Rifles), as part of the tripartite agreement that was signed at the time of India's independence. This is further documented in a list of Gurkha regiments serving under the Indian Army.[14]

The Gurkha were the backbone of the British colonial forces. They took part in and won major battles in Subcontinental history and were the absolute Apex of the Elite, taking on the most difficult missions and beating back numerically superior forces. Individually, they were the fiercest, most athletic hand to hand fighters and also the best sharpshooters. The Gurkha, like the Tibetans, are adapted to High Altitudes, making them natural warriors and athletes.

&gt;""Asian Indians tend to have more abdominal adipose tissue, less lean body mass (LBM) and higher magnitude of insulin resistance (IR) despite falling in the normal range of body mass index (BMI) [1]. The high value of waist hip ratio in Asian Indians may be due to less lean mass of the hips and greater fat at the levels of waist [2]. Another study showed that Asian Indian men have low muscle mass and 30% more total body fat (BF) than other ethnic groups [3]. Low lean mass is also evident in Asian Indian neonates as compared to white Caucasian neonates [4]."" http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0040977

&gt;‚ÄúIn general, excess body fat tends to be accompanied by an increase in muscle mass,‚Äù said Scott Lear, a researcher at Simon Fraser University in Canada and lead author of the study. ‚ÄúBut South Asians had significantly less lean mass than each of the three other groups.‚Äù

&gt;Dipprasad Pun, CGC (Nepali: ‡§¶‡§ø‡§™‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§™‡•Å‡§®) is a Nepalese sergeant of the Royal Gurkha Rifles who was decorated with the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for an act of bravery during the War in Afghanistan on the night of 17 September 2010.[2] Pun, then an acting sergeant, single-handedly defeated 30 Taliban insurgents who were storming his control post near Babaji in Helmand province.[3]

&gt;Immediately prior to the engagement, Pun, who was with the 1st battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, was on sentry duty at a checkpoint guarding his unit's compound. Taliban fighters, planting bombs near the compound gate under the cover of darkness, suddenly surrounded and attacked his post with AK-47s and RPGs. Acting Sergeant Pun, alone and believing he was about to die, decided to kill as many of the enemy as possible.[3] During the engagement he reportedly spent all his ammunition (more than 400 rounds), used 17 hand grenades and a Claymore mine before battering the last fighter with the tripod of his machine gun. Two Taliban were still attacking his post when he set off the Claymore mine.[3]

&gt;Upon receiving the award, Pun said that he had no choice but to fight; the reason being that the Taliban had surrounded his checkpoint, and that he was alone. During the engagement, Pun saved the lives of three of his comrades and prevented his post from being overrun. His actions are cited as ""the bravest seen in his battalion during two hard tours"".[4][5][6][7]

9,"Corporal Leslie Allen - The ""Bull""","I found this bio about a specific WWII soldier and thought it would be good to share it with you guys.

This soldier is not known for his fighting skill, not remembered as a warrior but as something much more higher.

Leslie was born on 9th November 1916, in Ballarat East, Victoria in Australia.
Nothing much is recorded of his childhood life except that he had to move to an orphanage in his early days.

Leslie joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 19th April 1940 and was soon sent to the Middle East. He was nicknamed ""Bull"" by his fellow soldiers after his manner of charge during rugby games.

He saw his first action as a stretcher-bearer in North African Desert Campaigns of 1941 and was proved efficient. However, he was soon diagnosed with ""anxiety neurosis"".
But, his time to fame was about to come.

He rejoined his battalion for Operation Exporter in July 1941 where he served and attended to wounded and injured soldiers all night under fire near Khalde and travelled ten kilometres in the next morning, to get a transport for them.

Allen's battalion was ordered to set sail to Papua in October 1942 after their brief stop in Sri Lanka. The battalion was to participate in the battles there.
It would be another prime moment in the Bull's life.

In an encounter in Crystal Creek, Allen rescued eight wounded soldiers under heavy enemy fire for which he was awarded the Military Medal.


In another famous encounter near Mount Tambu on 30th of July 1943, Allen rescued twelve american soldiers and was awarded the Silver Star.

All this fame and great sacrifice won't influence his fortunes as he returned home in 1943 with unstable conditions probably from his anxiety neurosis. He lost his speech as well.
After the war, Leslie would do many small jobs before passing away on 11th May 1982.

The world might have forgotten about the Bull's deeds but we can surely say that the men whom he rescued would never forget him and so won't we.",history,1482575997,ShogunOfDarkness,4,14,True,2016-12-24

79,Some f*cked up stuff during WW1 (ethically),"So my great grand-father was a NCO in the Belgian Army during WW1 and stationed on the front lines. This is what I found in some of his memoires.
His mission was to do a recon mission so he was supposed to move toward the front lines and look where the germans are, how many germans, their equipment, ... During that time in Belgium this was basically just waiting until they saw germans and doing a rough estimate of how many there were.
This is written by my grandmother:

I once heard my dad speak with uncle Lucien about something that still bothered him alot. After a lot of hesitation he told me his story, which later turned out to be the story about his degradation! As a corporal he was assigned to do a recon mission with a couple of soldiers in 1914. But because the front was constantly changing at the time they accidentaly turned up behind German lines. They hid until they could return to their own lines. When they reported back to their commanding officers, he got immediatly demoted. He bitterly said that if you did this today you would be celibrated for not risking the lives of others in a suicide mission but back then they punished you for it.


I just thought this stuff is really messed up and perfectly shows how bad the commanding officers were

Ik hoorde vader eens spreken met nonkel Lucien over iets dat hem blijkbaar nog steeds zeer hoog zat. Na lang aarzelen vertelde hij mij zijn verhaal, wat later zijn verhaal over zijn degradatie bleek te zijn! Hij moest als korporaal een verkenningsopdracht uitvoeren tesamen met een aantal soldaten tijdens de veldtocht in ‚Äô14. Ongelukkiglijk kwamen ze, daar het front steeds wisselde, achter de Duitsers terecht! Ze staken zich weg, tot ze terug konden keren naar de eigen linies. Toen ze zich een paar dagen later terug aanmelden bij hun oversten, werd hij op staande voet gedegradeerd. Hij vertelde bitter dat je de dag van vandaag ervoor gefeliciteerd zou worden het leven van de anderen niet in gevaar te hebben gebracht, maar dat het er toen heel anders aan toe ging.",history,1482628450,lekajo,51,22,True,2016-12-24

16,old west salloon beer - what was it like?,"I'm a big lover of all things victorian, and since i grew up in front of a tv set, and watched alot of westerns, the historical reality of the old west has always held a sort of otherworldy mystic. it's like looking into the life of a grandparent who you always saw as grandpa or grandma, but had an untold and amazing life story before you that is only hinted at.

I'm wondering, if I were to go into a salloon from about 1850-1885, and have a beer, what would be the most common thing I would be served? Would it be lager or ale, dark or pale, hopped or sweet? I know that 35 years is a big length of time, but was there a general pattern or style popular in that era?

this next bit is a ramble;

I know that most salloons were one bit or two bit businesses; walk up to the bar and set a 25 cent peice down [2 bits, because 4 is a dollar, and eight spanish peices of 8 equals a peso/dollar], and you get either a gill of liqour, a pint of beer, or a nicer cigar. Seems gin was just as popular as whiskey, and the whiskey was just corn or mollasses based based moonshine that was unaged and generally 40-50 abv when watered down by the distributor/ bottler. 

Mixed drinks were also very popular as one got closer to cities, as was fruit based wine. There wasn't much of a market for costly or fancy alcohol, nor a reason for one to exist. Whiskey was only fuel for other activities that made the saloon it's real profit. Saloon owners also liked cheap whiskey, as they could charge a reasonable cost per drink, and come out with more profit that an expensive liqour would allow them.

The two bit salloons were the fancy ones, and the vast bulk of saloons were one bit establishments. The cigars of the era were generally totally domestic, with tobacco from the Miamai valley of Ohio, or Pennsylvania. The smaller ones with cut off bits, stems and often poorly aged scrap that was full of amonia were called 'penny stinkers'. Better smokes were 2 for a nickel and called twofers. A one bit cigar would have been imported from Cuba. They really are nothing special, and I'd venture to say that most people would have just gotten the drink.

If you'd like to replicate the whiskey, take the cheapest vodka you can find [American Pride or Potters generally], and add to ea 300ml, just enough mollasses to give it a brown hew. A few drops of vanilla or rye extract and there you have it. To replicate the cigar, strip the outer wrapping leaf, not the binding leaf, off of a swisher sweet or phillies cigar.",history,1481966552,esperanto5,8,12,True,2016-12-17

3,Ancient and old works of history,"Hey there, I have recently started to read old books on history. Basically the ancient books that recorded what happened during their time or that recorded the things that happened in earlier times.

My preference is ancient history as the title says. My interst is not only in history per se, but also in the developement of history, literature, science etc. and reading those old books is very interesting to me.

So far I have read:

 * Histories by Herodotus (currently reading)
 * History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides
 * The Persian Expeditions by Xenophon

Now I am looking for some more interesting stuff, especially stuff that would not be from the western world, but that would talk about china and other asian areas for example.

So far I have in my reading list:

 * Hellenica by Xenophon
 * The Rise of the Roman Empire by Plybius
 * The Conquest of Gaul and The Civil War by Iulius Caesar
 * The History of Rome by Titus Livy
 * The History of Alexander by Quintus Curtius Rufus
 * The Annals of Imperial Rome by Tacitus
 * The Twelve Caesars by Suetonius
 * Parallel Lives by Plutarch (more biography)
 * The Campaigns by Alexander by Arrian
 * Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers (biography stuff as well)
 * Recors of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian (only asian book I have)

I know there is a lot of more stuff when it comes to the old roman and greek times, so if anyone has some works that are execptionally feel free to put them here. If you have great non-greek works, feel free to put them in here. Thanks!

61,"The pronunciation of 'Caesar', &amp; the legacy of 'The Third Rome'. - Is The Roman Empire still alive?","*(I don't have a history degree)*


In **Classical Latin** '*C*' was pronounced as '*K*', which is why Caesar was pronounced as **""Kaisar""**

Yes.. Kaiser.

* You've probably heard the title later used by the German Kaisers of **The Holy Roman Empire**

* **The Tsardom of Russia** also used the title. The alternate spelling for Tsar is **Czar**, which means Kaiser

* The Holy Roman Empire and The Tsardom of Russia both considered themselves as *""Third Rome""* - The continuation of the Roman Empire.
[Which Empire was the true *Third Rome* is still heavily debated today] - (Second Rome being **The Eastern Roman Empire**, later *'The Byzantine Empire'*)

* In **World War 1**, Russian Soldiers were known to have a chant in relation to retaking *Constantinople*, - Meaning that they wished to restore **The Third Rome**

It boggles the mind how something so absolutely fascinating as the continuation of *The Roman Empire* has been completely ignored in my education.

How I came across this was when researching the history behind the title of 'Kaiser'. There were no connections to the other information I've listed, and I had to connect dots on my own.
It's not like it makes me a genius by any means, but it's quite odd how this has not been documented properly. Am I wrong?
Honestly I'm asking. This is investigative history and I might very well have it all wrong.

Started reading Wiki pages about it, how it is fiction but has many accurate depictions of privateering during the American Revolutionary War. I am not well read in history at all, but I think I could enjoy it. In college I took one history course my senior year, American History After the Civil War and loved it. (If I could go back I think I would have enjoyed being a history major rather than an English major.)

45,"Ferdinand Marcos, a Filipino dictator, recently buried in the Heroes' Cemetery. Is there a comparable person or event in history who has had a similar treatment?","So I live in the Philippines.

The 1970s-80s period was considered one of the darkest times in the country's history. This was because then-president Ferdinand Marcos instituted Martial Law, and pretty much became dictator for life.

During that time there were numerous cases of human rights abuses, torture, assassinations, cronism, and billions of dollars of funds were stolen.

Marcos was eventually ousted in 1986; he died in exile in the US in 1989.

----------------------

Fast forward to more recent years. His widow, son, daughter and members of the extended clan have all held/are holding high positions of power in the government. His son actually came close to winning the vice-presidency in a recent election.

One of the long-standing issues was his burial in the Heroes' Cemetery - where only presidents, war heroes, National artists, scientists - and generally individuals who have given pride to the Philippines are allowed to be buried in.

Marcos was a former president (albeit a corrupt one), and had also served in World War 2 (his military record though had conflicting reports and noted to have had a lot of embellishments or fabrications).

Recently, the Supreme Court ruled that it was OK to bury him in the Heroes' Cemetery, and a few days ago his remains were ""rushed"" to be interred there - ie. *pretty much the entire country had been surprised because the ceremony was hush-hush.*

-----------------------------

I know that Lee Kuan Yew (Singapore) and Park Chung-hee (South Korea) have some similarities. Both were dictators, repressed freedoms, censored free press and speech, and were iron-handed when it came to dissidents - just like Marcos.

However, I cannot recall major instances of corruption in their regimes - *certainly not to the extent that $10 billion was reportedly stolen (Marcos' case).*

Marcos' policies and corruption were also considered the major causes of the Philippines being crushed by debt - ie. *borrowing a lot from foreign sources, building infrastructure, pocketing some funds on the side, the country not being able to pay it back.*

In contrast, Lee and Park were both credited for single-handedly uplifting their countries into becoming leading nations in Asia. Marcos' term meanwhile led the Philippines to a downward spiral.

------------------------

**So my questions for Reddit historians and students:**

(1) Are there comparable instances or leaders throughout history among democratic nations/republics?

(2) Have leaders of these democracies, after the history books touted them as villains/evil/corrupt/etc. been given heroes' burials? If yes, how did their populace react?

Thanks.

NOTE 1: I've specified democracies/republics since monarchies and totalitarian states would usually have a grand ceremony for their rulers despite how terrible they were.

NOTE 2: I've also stated some examples of problems caused by the Marcos regime. There may be other leaders who've been faulted a bit, or those who ""may have opposition/enemies"", but I'm looking for something comparative to Marcos'.",history,1479564714,el2mador,6,7,True,2016-11-19

61,Authentic Vedic Hymn recital - Follow up post.,"I posted a version of the *ghana patha* recital of the *Gayatri* Mantra. Pleasantly surprised by the degree of attention it got in this sub. I am going to post a few more details about the *Gayatri* and the *Vedas* for clarification.

This mantra is found in the 10th Mandala of the *Rig Veda*. This hymn is traditionally attributed to have been recorded by the family of the sage *Vishwamitra*.

The *Rig Veda* is probably the oldest religious text in currency. The basic text had a definite form by around 1700-1600 BC. The other vedas are more recent, and were finally edited, according to an estimate, in the current form by around 1100 BC. The 4 vedas are by no means invariant texts, there are for example two major ""recensions"" of the *Yajur veda* (""black"" and ""white""). But within the ""branches"" (skt. *""shakha""*) or schools of the Veda, the text is remarkably preserved, through the oral tradition.

Recitation of the veda texts is called *patha*. The 4 Vedas are thematically organized into 4 parts - *Samhitas* (""Collections"" lit ""brought together"") these contain the core vedic mantras, *Brahmanas*- (Texts that elaborate on the significance and meaning of the samhita mantras), *Aranyaks* - Manuals of ritual and *Upanishads* - philosophical texts. 

Many mnemonic tools were devised to create multiple recitations of the same vedic text. Since different students learnt different recitations, errors creeping in on lineage of transmission could probably be rechecked against the text available from other lineages. Mnemonic rules are used to generate these readings from the core text.  A video on the the chanting and the tradition on the Unesco channel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPcasmn0cRU

**Samhita patha** - the basic recitation, including the *sandhi* rules.

**Pada Patha** - since Vedic language joins words together based on certain euphonic rules of concatenation (*sandhi*), *pada patha* includes a word-by-word recitation without the usual euphonic concatenation.

**Jata patha** ‚Äì Chanting has a slightly intricate pattern represented as follows: {1,2;2,1;1,2}, {2,3;3,2;2,3}, {3,4;4,3;3,4},..

**Ghana patha** ‚ÄìThe most intricate form represented as -  {1,2;2,1;1,2,3;3,2,1;1,2,3}, {2,3;3,2;2,3,4;4,3,2;2,3,4}, {3,4;4,3;3,4,5;5,4,3;3,4,5},

A person who has learnt a particular style of recitation is called a *pathin*.

The sound of the veda and not only the text is considered sacred. It is of utmost importance that the Veda be transmitted not only textually but along with the accent and the manner of pronunciation. Comparing different existing versions extant in veda schools in India today, one can safely say that a surprisingly large corpus of Vedic material has come to us largely unaltered over 3000 years. One must add not only the mnenomic system, but the fact that Sanskrit had a formalized grammar atleast by the 4th century BC. *Panini* formalized sanskrit grammar and the extent of his morphological analysis was unparalleled in the western world until about the mid 20th century. The objective is to say that the ancient vedic priests and transmitters of the oral tradition had the necessary tools to transmit the vedas orally and in near-perfect condition over millenia. Today there is more controversy over the meaning of the text than the text itself.

As far as the vedas today are considered, brahmin families continue to learn and recite the vedas in the original language, with the accent and pronunciation. The mantra in the video is the *Gayatri* mantra, and is very popular. It is notorious for having a vedic metre named after, which the traditional text doesn't conform to (the controversy between *varenyam* and *vareniyam*)

63,Athenian Naval Society: A short collection of insights into the Athenian Navy and Trireme battles,"The majority of the information presented in this post has been gathered by John Rigby Hale and expressed in his major work ‚ÄúLords of the Sea: The Epic Story of the Athenian Navy and the Birth of Democracy‚Äù. I simply wish to convey a few interesting Historical facts and concepts that have been discovered about the Athenian Navy during its Golden age (480 BC-404 BC) and present insights into Athenian Naval society to the r/History Community.  

First and foremost, the cornerstone of the Athenian Navy, is without a doubt, the Trireme warship. This monstrous three decked machine of war could reach speeds of 10 knots and deliver deadly blows with its ram whilst engaged in naval combat. However, several myths and misconceptions surround this truly astonishing ancient warship. 
One of the major symbols of the ancient Trireme is decks of slaves, chained to their oars, rowing as a form of forced labour. However, this is simply untrue. During the Athenian Golden age, all rowers onboard a trireme warship would have been free-men, whether employed as full-time mariners, or civilian volunteers giving service during times of war. The myth of mass galley-slaves was solidified in Lew Wallace‚Äôs ‚ÄúBen-Hur‚Äù and given further credit in Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Finest Story in the World‚Äù.  
One account does exist however, in which a small band of slaves were boarded onto a Trireme as rowers out of desperation, when they returned victorious to port, they were proclaimed free-men and granted citizenship. 
Serving onboard a trireme was great honour, and several playwrights, historians, politicians and philosophers where granted honorary officer ranks in the Athenian fleet. Honorary officers included statesman Pericles, historian Thucydides and playwright Sophocles, even Socrates spend a short period of his life onboard a Trireme. Little to no records of mutinies exist at this time, and whipping or beating rowers was unheard of. In the Golden age, civilians of all classes would come together to serve in the Athenian Navy, regardless of class and social structure. 

Naval power naturally protected commerce, and maritime trade helped make Athens the richest city on the Mediterranean.  The ancient Greeks knew that building a navy was an undertaking with clear political undertones. The naval tradition of Athens helped solidify democracy, which was described as ‚Äúa democracy based on Triremes‚Äù. 

Trireme battles in the ancient world are often misrepresented. Foremost, all trireme battles had to be fought within the sight of a landmass, and always on calm waters. Because of these conditions, prime time for a naval engagement would have been the early morning. Controlling land became as important as controlling waterways, due to the venerability of ancient ships, especially the Trireme, to high waves, and rotting. Triremes were required to report to dry-docks in the evening, where the crew would anchor them to dry out. Triremes battles were often quick and deadly, with combat being broken off if winds began to blow. Furthermore, masts and sails were so useless on Triremes that they were often left behind before a crew would row out to sea in the morning. 

There is still much that can be discussed about the importance of Naval power in ancient Athens, I would highly recommend ""Lords of the Sea"" for further insights on the topic of Trireme warfare, ancient democracy and Athenian society.

76,A selection of British Cold War nuclear secrets,"From the late 1940s through to the early 1990s, the US and its allies became involved in a nuclear standoff with the USSR. 

The UK played a large part in the West‚Äôs nuclear plans and was a priority target for a Soviet nuclear strike. 

If the worst had have happened would Britain‚Äôs cold war plans have worked? This selection of British Cold War nuclear facts makes for some interesting reading.

**The Queen‚Äôs Floating Bunker**

Under the so called ‚ÄúPython System‚Äù the Queen would be put aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia to escape the falling bombs.

The plan was to hide the yacht in the sea lochs of North West Scotland, moving at night from one loch to the other. The high mountains would prevent Soviet radar from discovering the boat while Her Majesty relaxed, sipping Beefeaters Gin.

The Queen had to be kept separate from the rest of Government because only she can appoint a Prime Minister. The Home Secretary and the Duke of Edinburgh came along for the ride too, as between the the three they could form a Privy Council and appoint a new Government.

And what of the existing Government? It was felt that the Prime Minister and War Cabinet wouldn‚Äôt last long in the event of war. The Soviets would find their secret location via radio traffic and wipe them out as soon as they started transmitting.

**The Royal Observer Corps**

The Royal Observer Corps was a volunteer organisation in the UK. At the height of the Cold War around 1500 bunkers were manned by trained civilians. At the sound of a siren, housewives, students and everyday workers would be called away from their families to go below ground.

The job of the ROC was to detect bomb blasts and radiation. This information would be passed to Home Office scientists who would calculate bomb size, direction and predict the path of nuclear fallout.

A typical observer post was nothing like the bunkers we see in the movies. A 20ft ladder would lead to an underground chamber only 7ft x 16ft x 7ft high. Conditions were hardly comfortable, with no running water, gas or mains electric. An observer would be expected to remain in these conditions for 2 to 3 weeks if there had been an attack on the UK. 

**The Letter of Last Resort**

You‚Äôre the commander of a nuclear submarine. You know that the political situation is more than a little shaky but as you‚Äôre deep under the ocean you don‚Äôt know exactly what‚Äôs going on. You surface and turn on the radio to listen for orders but hear nothing. What now?

The Letter of Last Resort was written for exactly this situation and still used today. Each Prime Minister writes a letter to be read only when all else is lost. The letter tells the commander how to proceed if the PM is dead and the chain of command is gone. 

Exactly how the commander would know that the UK had been reduced to a pile radioactive ash is still classified. Curiously the only check we know about for sure is whether or not Radio 4 is still broadcasting.

A letter is located in a safe in the command room of each nuclear armed sub and the contents are unknown. Does it tell the commander to retaliate, go over to a friendly nation and hand over his sub, or sail to a tropical island and live out the rest of his life eating coconuts? No-one but the Prime Minister knows for sure.

**The ‚ÄòStay Behind‚Äô Network**

During the Cold War, the US and the UK set up a top secret network to cause serious problems for would be Soviet invaders. The network was so secret that the British didn't acknowledge its existence until the mid nineties.

Based on World War II resistance units and managed by the CIA and MI6 (British Intelligence), the networks were trained by the best in the business; the US Green Berets and the British SAS.

If an invasion did happen, members of the stay behind network would stay behind to harass and confuse Soviet invaders. Trained in a range of techniques including assassination and covert operations the units would have been a real annoyance to the enemy.

Units of the SAS would hide in West Germany ready to emerge in the event of a takeover. Some people believe that this happened in the UK too, with soldiers waiting to strike back after a nuclear war. The powers that be have never admitted that these operations happened on UK soil, but do admit it happened in Europe. 

**The Emergency Government War Headquarters**

120ft below the Wiltshire countryside, a kilometre long complex codenamed ‚ÄòBurlington‚Äô sat waiting to protect the senior figures of British government.

Burlington would shelter the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and a bunch of civil servants and domestic staff for at least three months from the effects of a Soviet nuclear strike. In all Burlington could house 4000 people, although many of them wouldn‚Äôt know until the last minute that they‚Äôd been selected to man the site.

Equipped with its own water, air and power supplies; the complex was kitted out with hospitals, kitchens, offices, its own telephone switchboard, a BBC studio and even a pub. 60 miles of roads connected everything together in a New York City grid style system, giving the PM plenty of chance to walk off his inevitable hangover and contemplate his next move. 

**Six Hours to Save the Nation‚Äôs Art Treasures**

As the old saying goes, ‚ÄúLife is nothing without art‚Äù. This was certainly taken to heart by the planners of ‚ÄòOperation Methodical‚Äô.

Drawn up in 1962 at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, an emergency plan was put in place to protect the UK‚Äôs art treasures. With six hours notice, Military trucks would pull up to London‚Äôs museums and art galleries, load up with goodies and head for quarries in Wales and Wiltshire, and to remote country houses in the Scottish Highlands.

Once there priceless pictures like Van Gogh's Sunflowers, Monet's Waterlilies and Constable's The Hay Wain would be stowed away safely to ride out the nuclear firestorm.

Some Civil Servants questioned the wisdom of Operation Methodical. One internal memo noted 'Whether [the plan] will have the faintest chance of succeeding... is another question,'

**The Four Minute Warning**

Should the Soviets decide to unleash a nuclear inferno upon Britain the Government of the day had a plan to give the people at least some warning. As enemy missiles came into range, the missile warning radar at RAF Fylingdales would give seven minutes warning of an attack.

The Home Office would alert 255 main Police stations across the country, who would activate large sirens (if they still worked) to alert the population. In more rural areas volunteers would sound the alarm using hand held sirens. The BBC was also instructed to broadcast warnings on all TV and radio channels.

The aim was to pass the message through the system in time to give people four minutes warning of a nuclear attack. And if you heard the alarm? Information films of the time advised people to go indoors, or lie down in a ditch. Happy days.

**The Role of the Police**

In the event of a nuclear attack the Cold War Cop had a special part to play. Responsible for guarding key areas, dealing with potentially ‚Äòsubversive people‚Äô, dispersing crowds and ‚Äòmarshalling the homeless‚Äô, the Police would be responsible for trying to hold society together after the bombs stopped dropping.

As manpower might become a bit of an issue, the Police could be supported by Specials (volunteers), Traffic Wardens and controversially psychopaths. The reason? Psychopaths would be ""very good in crises"" because ""they have no feelings for others, nor moral code, and tend to be very intelligent and logical‚Äù.

Although British Coppers rarely carry weapons, after a nuclear war it was thought that the they should be armed to allow them to keep law and order. Buying a load of guns would be too expensive though, and the public would not be happy if they found out. The solution? The Police would be armed with rifles used by the Army Cadet Corps.

**Keep Calm and Carry On**

Clearly the day-to-day laws of Cold War Britain would need to be rethought if a nuclear attack were to happen. British authorities realised this and held many planning exercises to try and figure out exactly what kinds of powers they would need.

Because it couldn‚Äôt be certain that Central Government would survive the nuclear attack, power would be delegated to a number of ‚ÄòRegional Commissioners‚Äô. Appointed by the Queen these commissioners would have the power to impose existing laws, and create new laws as and when needed without having to go through Parliament.

As the situation became more critical a number of things would begin to happen. All schools would close, hospital patients would be mass discharged and prisoners would be released. Any resources required by the authorities including, property, people and goods could be requisitioned.

The most important thing was to ensure that people kept calm and didn‚Äôt panic. This would be accomplished by keeping changes on a need to know basis, and presenting a positive outlook to the nation.

**Too Close to Midnight**

It‚Äôs 1983. A Korean Airlines Boeing 747 has been shot down by the Russians after mistakenly straying into Soviet airspace. President Reagan has announced the ‚ÄòStar Wars‚Äô strategic defence initiative and tension between the US and the USSR is at an all time high.

Cue ‚ÄòOperation Able Archer‚Äô. An exercise involving 40,000 US and NATO troops moving across Western Europe, co-ordinated by encrypted communications.

British Intelligence receives information that the USSR has given orders for aircraft in West Germany and Poland to be armed with Nuclear weapons. Soviet nuclear submarines begin to submerge under the Arctic Ice to avoid detection by allied troops.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is briefed. The Soviet response is not an exercise. This is a genuine preparation for warfare. The NATO exercise had been mistaken as a hostile action.

It was at this point that the British leaders realised how close to midnight they had come and how lucky we were not to sleepwalk into a third world war. The Russians were informed of future exercises and steps were put into place to prevent this from happening again.

Please feel free to correct my mistakes.

Solaks were formed during the rule of Bayezid I. They were carefully picked warriors from the janissary barracks and their role in the army was guarding the sultan. Requirements of Solaks are mentioned in the book ""Kavanin-i Yeni√ßeriyan(Janissary Laws)"" as: ""One to become a Solak must be sturdy; must not be young boy, beardless or short(dwarf) for they are assigned to walk in front of the sultan. Their duties consist shooting arrows, striking enemies and training the rookies."" As we can understand from here Solaks were experienced, well-built warriors and good archers.

Solak units had chiefs called ""Solakba≈üƒ±"" or ""Sersolak"" and 4 of them would walk beside the sultan, 2 on his left and 2 on his right. Ones that walked on Sultans right side would hold their bows with their right hand and string with the left, so they dont turn their backs on the sultan when shooting. (I also heard holding the bow with the right hand lets them to aim to their right when they are riding a horse, allowing guard unit to shoot arrows towards almost every possible angle without changing the direction of their horses)

Their total numbers were about 200 during the conquest of Istanbul, and were increased to 80 for every Solak unit at the time of Suleiman I. Their primary weapon was bow and arrow and  they also carried a dagger. They trained shooting everyday at Okmeydanƒ± (literally means arrow square and still called like that today) and they kept using bow and arrow even after rifles took their place in Ottoman army.

I admittedly don't have a ton of history background that will be useful here; most of the history stuff I know is so specialized/liberal arts college style subversive that it's basically useless for my class. For example, the history of Black Christianity in the US: Super Interesting! But Also super not on any state tests, or related to anything they're going to be expected to do next year :( 


At any rate, whether it's on a test or not, I would really like to start including at least a little information about People of Color in my lessons/their reading. We're about to start the Reformation. I know it's pretty much just a European topic, but I feel like there had to be SOME non-white movers and shakers in the Reformation. Just from a numbers standpoint, it seems really unlikely that *everyone* involved was white. I've found a little bit about Calvinism gaining a foothold on the African continent in the mid 1600s, but that's getting a bit ahead of us--we're still dealing with around 1500. Does anybody know any resources about POC involved in the Reformation or the direct aftermath? Or how the Reformation impacted non-European societies in the 1500s? Really, I'd be super grateful for any resources on POC in European history.  
If there's any other middle grade history teachers out there, I'd much appreciate any resources or advice ya'll have on making materials more inclusive :)

I need to demonstrate how a primary source document describing the riches of Mali at the time of the Plague illustrates my overarching theme which is an analysis of the patterns of where the Plague hit. Cannot for the life of me explain why this primary source was given to us. Sure its interesting that this region apparently escaped the effects of the Plague and prospered but I cannot connect it to the larger theme of why certain areas were hit and others were not--it seems like an anomaly. Actually, everything this primary source focuses on goes AGAINST the reasons for the pattern of where the plague hit:

-focuses on trans-saharan trade/ how dense trade traffic was in Mali  (trade/mongols being the most obvious answers to why plague spread)
-entire thing demonstrates a ton middle eastern/Islamic influence in Malian culture (middle east was hit by plague)
-describes individuals on pilgrimage to Mecca and then coming back including Malian king himself (mecca itself was hit by the plague)
-the person who wrote the primary document was an arab traveler himself 
-crappy disposal of dead bodies (typical way plague spread by mongols)
-talks about how its a country rich in livestock
-talks about how much of an effect Malian gold is having on Egyptian economy and causing inflation (Egypt was hit by plague)

I assume that it was some sort of an anomaly that despite the extensiveness of their trade across the Sahara + exchange with Islamic world, the Plague just couldn't cross the sahara?

98,Information on (WW1?) Ring.,"http://imgur.com/a/GvCvx

I came into possession of this ring a while ago, after my grandfathers death but didn't give it much thought. Recently my curiosity about its origins started rising, and I started looking for information on it.

As you can see, it's a crudely shaped ring, with 3 lines on the setting, two of which are empty, and one has some kind of brownish metal inlay material laid in. On one shoulder there are numbers that say: 14(?)-16, and some marks which could be either shapes, or merely damage. The ring is quite damaged.

It resembles World War 1 trench art. My country fought on the side of Central Powers, mainly Austria-Hungary, on the Italian front (Battles of the Isonzo).

19,How is Napoleon III seen outside France ?,"The Third Republic heavily diabolised Napoleon III , he became ""Napoleon the Petty "" (in opposition to Napoleon the Great ) ,was a bad ruler, responsible for the French defeat of 1870 etc .

But when we studied him , he was really not that bad, he reestablished France diplomatically, improved relations with the United Kingdom, helped the Italian unification by weakening the Habsburg, his rule was a mecenate for scientists  ( I remember he loved sciences,  and he financed Louis Pasteur, the guy who discovered vaccines, and he appreciated the electricity experiments ). France entered the industrial age with him , and during the end of his rule he liberalised the Empire politically. When he faced the Germans he prefered surrender his army rather than let his soldiers be butchered. Overall, he looked more like an unlucky guy which faced Bismark with not much military qualities than a incompetent tyrant which led the nation crumble . So , he was kind of despised during a long time in France, but what about in other countries ?

73,"Information on Wilhelm Stieber, Bismarck's spy master?","I came across Stieber in Butterworth's 'The World that Never Was' and Alistair Horne's 'The Fall of Paris', and afterward learned more of his setting up a vast Prussian spying system before war with Austria, then France.

But other resources I've found all seem to draw almost exclusively from his autobiography, 'The Chancellor's Spy'. And mentions of him are sparse regardless. It baffles me that someone apparently so influential-- godfather to later modern German spy systems, who also had a hand in shaping the Russian secret service  before it became the Okhrana-- has practically zero literature about him. No third-party biographies, no works, etc. And I've read elsewhere that in Bismarck's own autobiography (which I have not personally read), Stieber's only mentioned a handful of times.

So my question is two-fold: Are there other, English resources about Stieber besides his autobiography? Even other works where he only pops up in a minor role, like the two I mentioned above? And, also, is there some reason he's been so little studed, especially with his connection to Bismarck-- a lack of first-hand materials, meager German translations, lack of interest, or that he was not so influential as he seems?

I do not know much about this stuff, and I am sure some of the stuff I wrote above might even be wrong. But I am searching for a nice book written about this topic.

91,Scots-Irish and questions of identity,"Many of my ancestors were the so called Scots-Irish.  I'm wondering just who these people were and what was the understanding of their own identity?

I've read Albions Seed and American Nations, along with a number of articles, many of whom give conflicting information.  This is largely centred around if the Scottish Lowlanders were Scots.  

Yes they were largely Presbyterian by the 1600s, spoke a dialect of English, did not typically wear kilts (although there is some conflicting information on if they wore tartan), and their music was centred on the violin/fiddle and not that bagpipes.

However, at the same time, many whose descendants would go on to become Americans (Pennsylvania, Carolinas, western Virginia largely) seem to have come from not only the Scottish Borders (and even Northern England), but Ayrshire, Glasgow, Argyll and Bute right into the beginnings of the Highlands in the west of Scotland.

My own family have gravestones in North Carolina decorated with thistles and Scottish iconography (they did go onto Ulster but didn't stay longer than 20 or so years).

Of course I am asking for the truth, when there may not be one answer one way or another.  From what I am reading, the Border Reivers, Convanters, farmers, weavers, to semi Highlanders all encompassed this group called the Scots-Irish (in America).

25,How easy it was for the Vikings to cross the Atlantic,"I was always curious about how much of an effort the Vikings had to put down to cross the Atlantic. Turns out to be quite doable IMO. By using Opentopomap and Freemaptool's Horizonfinder I made this map (http://imgur.com/gallery/3smde) to show how far the Vikings had to venture into the unknown before land in the horizon disappeared behind them and before new land would appear in the horizon in front of them.

I have plotted the visible horizon from the most prominent peaks at the shores of the respective lands. As you can see, there is a lot of prominent peaks visible at great distances offshore all along their assumed trial. Perfectly suited for discovering new land. 

The longest unguided stretch is between the Faroe's and Iceland (picture) and would take roughly 10 hours under favorable conditions (182 km at 10 knots). A wee bit longer than the distance between Amsterdam and Brussels. 

If we take into account high probability of mirages in arctic waters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage#Superior_mirage) and the fact that the longships had masts up 16 meters high (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longship#Sail_and_mast)
extending range of 15 km either direction, it is quite possible that they could see land through the entire journeys with favorable conditions. 

During the polar summer the days are long, weather is pleasant and the Vikings probably had plenty of time on their hands, so they could probably tailor their time to explore. Moreover, the wide angle of error possible before missing land could mean 
that precise navigation was not very important. Now if they could sustain themselves during the journey by hunting and fishing it must have been a pretty straightforward task. 

Having sailed from Shetland to Norway myself in less than 24 hours during summer (350 km), I can say that it is surprisingly lenient. Additionally, I found some pictures of Sn√¶fjell taken from Reykjavik to illustrate how much you can see at the eh.. event-horizon. Reykjavik lies right on the edge of the red circle around Sn√¶fjellsnes. 
It is still clearly visible indeed, and if ""lost"" at sea, a welcome sight. For more fun on calculating horizon distances you could use this simple calculator. (http://members.home.nl/7seas/radcalc.htm)

RoK controlled territory was considered some of the safest areas.
Captured Vietcong transcripts warned never to engage the Koreans unless victory was certain (especially in hand to hand combat becuase every korean knew taekwondo).
Huge amounts of weapons seizures by RoK forces.
Unofficial KDR in the vicinity of 16:1 some estimates being as high as 25:1.
and just a bunch of commendations from the US in general on their effectiveness...

I also found a lot of things on war crimes like the fact that when they searched villages suspected of harboring VC if even one shot came towards RoK forces the entire village would be wiped out for harboring the vietcong (this deterred most villages in helping the VC)... or the fact that they took the ears of vietcong as trophies...

19,andrea grimaldi and his clockwork ornithopter,"it would be nice if somebody here could tell me anything about this curious story. apparently there was some person who allegedly flew over la manche in 1751 in a flying machine of unclear construction. i don't say it actually took place, it likely was a hoax or a fraud, but still, it would be interesting to find its source. 

wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aviation_pioneers) mentions two books, both of which are freely available on the internet - Turner, Charles Cyril (1912). The Romance of Aeronautics (https://archive.org/details/romanceofaeronau00turn) pp 254-256 and Milizia, Francesco (1826). The Lives of Celebrated Architects, Ancient and Modern (Vol. II) (https://archive.org/details/livesofcelebrate02mili) p 152

the first of these books, ""the romance of aeronautics"" (whose author didn't consider that claim as true) has a lengthy text of a letter, whose original (apparently written in italian) is supposedly stored in ""the municipal library at Bergamo"". the letter was written in london on 18th october 1751, but the book doesn't mention by whom and to whom. it describes in detail the flying machine as some kind of wind-up ornithopter which also additionally used ""a large and powerful magnet"" for its motion and had a system of ""six vessels of brass containing quicksilver"" which was supposed to help ""to keep the machine in equilibrium and properly balanced"". the letter mentions that the aviator visited london and demonstrated his machine there which we obviously have no records of. it would be nice to know who wrote that letter! ""the romance of aeronautics"" also mentions that the same story can be found in several books of that time and it specifically names one of them as ""The History of the Year 1751, printed at Amsterdam at the cost of F. Pitteri, publisher, of Venice"" and briefly quotes another, which likely is the second of the aforementioned two books, ""the lives of celebrated architects"", albeit it likely quotes its italian original, because the quote is not exact to the english translation of milizia's book, albeit very close.

the second of these books, ""the lives of celebrated architects"", mentions this story rather briefly in much less details, it is mentioned it in the relation with some supposed records of italians who tried to fly with gliders (including one of the architects that book is about, paolo guidotti of lucca, who lived in 16th-17th centuries) and is given as the only example of the true flight unlike ""an easier and slower method of falling"" of the gliders. the author believes that the flight was indeed true, hopes that ""It is possible that posterity may consider this invention much to our honour"" and, what's the most interesting, mentions that ""This fact is most seriously recorded in the ‚Äú Modern History.‚Äù"". it would be nice to know if the ""modern history"", mentioned by milizia, is the same pitteri's book or not... probably it is.

now, ""The History of the Year 1751, printed at Amsterdam at the cost of F. Pitteri, publisher, of Venice"" is actually possible to find, in italian only though, it's apparently this one ""la storia: dell'anno 1751"" by pitteri (https://books.google.ru/books/about/La_storia.html?id=vMYGAAAAcAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y), the event is described at pp 225-229. frankly, i can't speak italian, but the google translate together with my mediocre knowledge of french helped me to decipher that it's basically the same letter, only in the original italian, with a brief introduction: ""La terza finalmente √® una stupenda scena, goduta anche quest'anno in Londra; se pure √® vera la seguente lettera, che si sa credere essere stata scritta di l√† ai 18. d‚ÄôOttobre; e su stampata in Italia, dov'era diretta"" (i.e. it's only the date of the letter and that it was apparently printed in italy) and without any conclusion, it's immediately followed with the record of death of the prince of wales.

it would be nice to find any other sources of this event and especially who printed the letter and who was the author and the addressee of it, if it existed as a letter and wasn't a purely printed hoax (but then, how about its supposed original in the library at bergamo?)

p.s. i just found out that apparently there was somebody who demonstrated a supposedly flying machine in london (a charlatan most likely) and of which another italian wrote a sensational letter home. it's a pity it seems impossible neither to find that issue of the newspaper nor even the full article of this abstract

&gt;Some interest was aroused in the middle of the eighteenth century when an Italian visitor to London exhibited a colourful flying machine which he promised to demonstrate. A full but comparatively little known report was published by the triweekly Whitehall Evening-Post in the issue dated 3rd-5th October 1751. Soon after its appearance, another Italian plagiarised it, sending a translation to a friend in Italy in the form of a letter, dated 18th October 1751, which purports to be an eye-witness account. This may have been published in Venice in the same year, as a fly sheet. In 1752 the letter and the flying machine were mentioned in a collection of noteworthy events, and in 1753 it was given cursory attention by Clemente Baroni Cavalcab√≤, in his famous book about the inability of demons to carry men through the air, The celebrated art historian Francesco Milizia included a brief summary in his biography of Paolo Guidotti, the painter and would-be aeronaut, and more recently the plagiarised text has been noticed by Italian historians of aviation.

30,"""Princeps Civitatis"": How the duplicitous propaganda of Julio-Claudian tyrants became the sincere governing maxim of the ""Five Good Emperors"" a century later.","(Sorry for the length of this, but these are some thoughts that have been percolating, and I would like to share them.)

The office known to common history as ""Roman Emperor"" is divided into a number of periods based on various factors, most broadly the actual title by which the ruler was distinguished from other officials.  

Emperor/Imperator was the title of their military capacity as supreme commander of the legions, but the central office of a ruler in the Roman Empire from Augustus until the late 3rd century CE was ""princeps civitatis"" - **First Citizen**.  Almost every name known to popular culture as a Roman Emperor was addressed as First Citizen.

The most notable exception, and the motivation for the creation of the term, was Julius Caesar.  The Roman Republic had a long tradition of appointing military leaders ""dictator"" to rule absolutely in a time of emergency, and (remarkably) they tended to leave power voluntarily.  Caesar thus took on a mantle of admired tradition when he took on himself the title ""dictator.""

But his own actions - making his dictatorship a lifetime appointment where traditionally it had been a few months or, under extraordinary abuse, more than a year - had unified perception of dictatorship with that of ""tyrant"".  

His successor, Octavian Augustus, thus decided it would not be prudent to associate himself too closely with the *role* of dictator when he took power.  Augustus wanted the power of dictatorship without the cultural expectation that it was temporary, nor the numerous other complications that long history had heaped on it.  He wanted, in essence, to be king - but like Caesar, knew that the actual title of ""king"" would be impossible to sustain in Roman society.  

The answer was [doublespeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublespeak) - and Augustus appears to be the first recorded ruler to have used it as a systematic strategy.  He called himself ""First Citizen of The Republic"" while ruling as a virtually lawless, wantonly terrorist, perpetual autocrat over a total monarchy.  

This is remarkable because in the rest of history, both before and after the [Principate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principate) state this act created, rulers tried to *magnify* perception of their power through often preposterously sycophantic rhetoric.  Thus the example - universally despised by republican states - of degenerate child-rulers born on the throne being sung songs in praise of their infinite wisdom, strength, and courage.

*Princeps* was the inversion of that insanity: A man who could and did murder anyone he found displeasing, inconvenient, or just *financially* worth more dead than alive; murdered anyone on the slightest supposition of a future suspicion that they might harbor thoughts to challenge his authority; answered to no one; and intended to wield this power for the rest of his life...this man pretended in rhetoric to hold a *civil* office of a *republic*.

Augustus' successors in the Julio-Claudian *and* Flavian dynasties both operated on his model, to varying degrees: They had no choice, even if their personal dispositions were not exceptionally tyrannical.  The state they inherited, the Principate, could only function through terrorist despotism combined with proto-totalitarian doublespeak loudly speaking in one direction while bloodily acting in the exact opposite.

The closest things to philosophic rule achieved during this period were reigns characterized by rulers who tried to underplay their power *even to other ambitious men* rather than just the citizenry.  Claudius spoke softly and tried to stay in the background, preferring the rule of mediator and ajudicator; Nero tried to be what the Romans of the time considered ""fun""; and given the length of both reigns, they were relatively successful.  But even in those cases, such was the paranoia - the thoroughly justified paranoia - that the occasional not-especially-discriminate purge/massacre was necessary just to survive.

A funny thing happened on the way to hell though: The rulers of early Principate were just successful *enough*, and provided just enough benefit and stability to the people of Rome, that over the following century the Romans started to *believe* the maxims and (frankly) bullshit that Augustus had made up to excuse making himself king.  And not just the people - the men who ran the Empire started to believe their own bullshit.

They grew up being lectured with the propaganda of the Principate, being told all about the philosophic motivations for its creation and the principles behind its operation.  And...they believed it.  Enough of them believed it that those who didn't found it less and less of a worthwhile gamble to go stabbing for the throne, and Rome ended up with a line of rulers (the ""Five Good Emperors"") who actually appeared to rule by some kind of philosophy rather than bottomlessly depraved expediency.

The reality should not be ignored that these men were still *kings*, still ruled mainly by fear (mixed in with some bribery), and still submitted to no outside authority despite their attempts to self-regulate in an enlightened way, but they were remarkably benign examples of the world they inhabited.  And we can marvel that such examples could be born out of naive acceptance of hypocrisy at face value.

It calls to mind the US Declaration of Independence, frankly - slave owners declaring all men equal in justifying a self-interested revolt, then their descendents taking them seriously and acting on the high ideals in the document.  But that's another part of history.

Hi everyone,

I'm an avid writer of history stories, have always loved studying history, and even go on alternate history websites, but for years I have been enamored with the Inka. I'm just amazed at how quickly they rose (and how quickly they fell, goddamnit Atawallpa) and was wondering just what the Andes looked like before Pachakutiq began his conquests. I've found [this wikipedia map] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Late-intermediate-peru.png) but I feel like there are more detailed resources out there.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, while a map is good and all, if anyone has more information (or a good website or book) about the Andes just before and during the rise of the Inka, I'd be *more* than happy to attain that.

&amp;nbsp;

Like I said, I absolutely love the Inka, how their government functioned, how they managed to do everything they did, etc., and I just want to learn about the political situation in the Andes that Pachakutiq subjugated.

But my wife and I are history buffs and we'll be visiting Paris in a few months. As the title says, we're feeling completely overwhelmed due to the huge history in this city. 

The thing we love most about visiting historical sites is imagining and picturing all of the people from the past who walked the same halls, marched in the same streets, flew in the same skies, etc. For example, when I went to London, I pictured all of the British citizens taking shelter during the blitzkrieg while I was in the London underground. I looked in the sky and pictured all of the German bombers flying overhead. I visited the Tower of London and imagined all of the terrified prisoners carving Latin scriptures on the stone walls, and saw the Thames and imagined all of the Victorian-Era police detectives looking at that same river while solving cases on the dark streets. 

It's weird, but I love imagining the history taking place while I'm walking in the place it happened in. It just blows my mind (and coincidentally, it's why the Assassins Creed games are the only videogames I play). 

So now that you know how weird I am, I can tell you that I don't know much about French history; definitely not enough to allow historical sites to come alive in my brain while I'm there. Did Nazis March on this street? I have no idea! Did Roman soldiers come through here? Was there a huge fight during the French revolution on this square? What big event happened at the notre dame? Where did they execute those monarchs? 

So I'm doing research on French history itself, but I'm having trouble relating it to exact places I can visit in Paris. Can you help? 

TL;DR: I love visiting historical places and letting the history come alive while I'm walking around the sites, and since I'm going to Paris, what are some of the best historical sites to visit where I can imagine some crazy stuff going down? Places where Roman troops were, Revolutionary battles, Nazis, Allies, Resistance, Napoleon, executions, I'm just so overwhelmed.",history,1473008800,Taizek,14,1,True,2016-09-04

Without a travel document he shall not travel. In the provincial towns the governors shall issue them travel documents without any delay.*

2. *If governors do not proceed to issue people travel documents quickly, and thus cause people delay and losses, and there are petitioners against them for that, and that is established conclusively: the governors shall be in great disgrace with the sovereign for that.

47,Why do you think WWII newsreels aren't used very often in teaching about the war?,"I have a weird semi-obsession with watching old newsreels, and honestly it's strange to me that they aren't used more often in teaching about world war 2, it's one thing to hear about the war, but it's another thing to see it going on, they're very plentiful, and they were made for the purpose of keeping the public on top of what was going on, so it would be easy to incorporate them into teaching. Most of them are public domain by now as well, so it wouldn't cost schools much. World War Two is such an interesting period of history that is extensively taught, especially here in the states since it put us front and center on the world stage (and also created a military industrial complex which takes up a majority of our country's budget, as well as create the narrative that america is always the hero no matter what we do that led us into not really winning a war since world war two, we 'won' in korea but it was more of a stalemate, and we 'won' in the first gulf war, but our victory only led to further interventions into the political quagmire that is the middle east, with each intervention making everything worse.) 
Anyways, if we're gonna teach world war two as much as we do, and we should, because of how interesting it was, the use of newsreels would really help make the war feel more three dimensional and human, when you just hear about the outcomes of battles or reasons for going into war, etc. One kind of loses touch with the war itself, seeing it as something monolithic, almost above humanity, when in reality it was a war OF humanity. Thousands of individual, personal events. Hearing about the battle of berlin is one thing, seeing the destruction of the city and the last, desperate defense of the germans as they enlist children to fight is another thing. I think newsreels would be a very beneficial thing for teaching, it wouldn't cost much money, and it would actually help teachers, i don't really know why we don't use them in schools.

Milan then saw numerous rulers after the fall of the Western Roman Empire with the House of Visconti, Sforza, Habsburgs, etc.

To Director of factory 18 Shankman
To Director of factory 1 Tretyakov

You have failed our country, our Red Army. You still don't bother to make IL-2. Airplanes IL-2 are needed by our Red Army as air, as bread. Shenkman makes one IL-2 per day, Tretyakov makes one-two MIG-3 per day. This is a mockery of the country, of the Red Army.

Stalin.

The House of Habsburg was arguably the most powerful family in Europe as well with Maria Theresa's sons, Leopold II and Joseph II both ruling the Holy Roman Empire in the 18th century and early 19th century and their father Francis I before that.

recently I'm getting really interested in Marcus Junius Brutus and the motives behind his decisions, could you suggest any books to expand on him or even just on the liberators?

Apart from an historical perspective I would also like to read something from a political or moral perspective if you can suggest something. Yes, I know that it's not the job of the historians to pass moral judgments.

Apart from that, I always thought that Brutus last words, as told by Plutarch, were ""O wretched Virtue, thou wert but a name, and yet I worshipped thee as real indeed; but now, it seems, thou were but fortune's slave."" 

I haven't read Plutarch's ""Parallel Lives"" yet but I took a quick look and I can't find these words, where are they from? Are they from ""Life of Caesar""?

Also, reading other Plutarch's works, do I need to keep something in mind? Should I read more recent authors?

47,Did China support the Zapatista uprising?,"So I've been reading a bit about the Zapatista movement in Mexico during the 90s and I noticed something about the weapons they have in a lot of the pictures. They are the expected AKM and AR-15 type rifles, but most of what they are carrying are Chinese SKS's and what look like Chinese M14 copies. I also noticed some Sten guns and PPsh type submachine guns which were used by China pretty large numbers. The SKS's and the M14's could have entered the US for civilian purchase and found their way on to the black market but it seems unlikely the numbers would be high enough that the Zapatistas would prefer buying them over AKM's, FN FAL's, G3's and AR-15's which are much more common(especially in that part of the world) and are more effective weapons anyway. Also, pictures of other rebel groups from Latin American from around this time, such as the Contras, show them using AKM's and FN FAl's almost exclusively(I know this  is probably because they were supported by the USSR). But by the 90s Russia was out of the foreign coup business and it seems like maybe China stepped up to support the Zapatistas and maybe some other leftist groups and may have supplied them weapons. I've tried googling Chinese involvement with the Zapatista movement but couldn't find anything. Are there articles in Spanish that I'm not finding?

**Absolute Monarchy**

Addressing the slave trade, it read along the lines of, ""While physical punishment was certainly a factor that kept slaves working to produce high-quality crops, an even larger factor was the possibility of family members being sold away if crops did not yield enough money for the plantation owners. Slaves worked to keep their families together.""

That really just portrays the horror of slavery in a way that no textbook has ever been able to for me.

I find it completely fascinating (and saddened) that a dictatorship could simply completely eliminate a very unique music scene and that to this day only a few recordings remain which document that this stuff even existed.  
  
On the other side of the spectrum, there are the [African-American Spirituals and Folk Songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_music#18th_century) that grew out of slavery and religious conversions in the United States, which are well documented and preserved.  
  
My question is: **Are there other examples of music, or specific genres of, that are directly related to or born out of political oppression in other parts of the world?**

Edit: I don't post often on Reddit so the varied responses really surprised me. I want to clarify my thoughts: I read about wars and murders and just move on. I seldom stop to think about what really happens. Then I read about the lynching of Claude Neil. The lynching is not the worst of what people do. It is pulling his nails out, kicking him, dragging him that is so much more evil. My ancestors, the Romans, were not the peaceful conquerors I used to believe they were. If a group of rebels caused too many problems, they would invade the town, slaughter everyone, torturing and raping along the way, then they would burn the town until nothing was left. Historically, each race has had their turn at being the oppressor and the oppressed. Today, when I read about the bombing of an area, I know the majority of deaths are those who want nothing to do with the war, and we never get that report in  the news. If someone is kidnapped, it is not likely the victim is enjoying a comfortable room with food and water while his kidnappers negotiate.

Could there be some truth to this trope, in which earlier kings or leaders would not always but more frequently display the virtues or greatness attributed to them, possibly due to the diplomatic prowess needed to unite and stabilize a nascent political entity at it's first stages, or the fresh patriotic spirit associated with it, or because these people shared some values their reign was founded on, or were motivated visionaries rather than just someone born to a long line of rulers with no particular personal attachment to his duty or the people under his rule? Or else things just got more tangled and resentful as time went on?

Some prominent examples I could name that might fit the stereotype of a ""great early ruler"" would be Alexander the Great, the first Islamic caliphs ( I.E Omar ), arguably Sargon of Akkad, or more modernly, the American founding fathers, who are sometimes idolized as the embodiment of American values, much moreso than later presidential candidates.

23,Multiple questions on the history of the Japanese language.,"So I did some reading the other day and I have a couple questions I couldn't find on the web.

From what I've read, the Japanese did not actually have a written language and due to the influence of the Chinese, the first written language of Japan was actually the Japanese using Chinese characters to represent their words.

So my first question is
1. I can't seem to understand, so if what was stated above true, then does that mean that the Japanese had a unified oral language before they even created a written one? How is it possible to get a whole landmass to speak the same language yet not develop and written one in the meantime?

2. If the above is true, does that mean that by the time of the first emperor Japan (Emperor Jimmu) there was still no written Japanese language? Was he the sole ruler of the Japanese island? Or were there others competing for power?

3. When did the Chinese first ""discover"" the Japanese island and it's inhabitants? How advance were the Japanese when they were first met? I'm unsure of what an isolated group of people can do, especially without a written language.

4. How the hell did the Chinese get to Japan? Did they use like a wooden boat or something to cross the East China Sea? Or did they go to Korea and then hopped onto a boat to Japan?

[On the experience of womanhood generally],"One thing that strikes me whenever I look at works from the golden age of oil painting and the old masters (Italy / Netherlands esp.), is how different the women represented look from those deemed worthy of representation currently.

I understand that the women shown in paintings done during that time were not necessarily selected for their beauty, but rather because they were the daughters or wives or cousins of noblemen and affluent merchants, in other words paying customers, but still :

Was a strong nose on a woman deemed attractive generally? By the well-to-do specifically? What about the rest?

75,Big Thompson Flood was forty years ago,"On July 31, 1976 a twenty foot wall of water swept down the Big Thompson Canyon in Colorado, destroying the town of Drake, basically everything else in the canyon and killed 144 people.

Normal river flow of the Big Thompson at Drake was 50 cubic feet per second, during the flood the flow was 30,100 cubic feet per second. It is estimated based on geological studies that it was the biggest flood in that canyon in 6,000 years.

I was there, as a seventeen year old. We were driving from Loveland to Estes park, or that was the plan. I knew it was a crisis and that we had to leave. The county sheriff who died told us to go so we knew that there the road was blocked and that there was a flood. We could see the water rising as we drove back down the canyon.

But we were still stunned by the magnitude of the disaster. You don't know what you are in when you are in it. I remember seeing people sitting on their cabin porches in Drake watching the rain, and I wonder how many of them died that night. No one I knew died in the flood, but with slightly different timing it could have been a life altering to life ending event.

Just an odd remembrance for the evening.

Metternich: a clever diplomat, who outwitted countless other diplomats. He wanted to make Europe a safe place, with the monarchies at the head and stamp out any sigh of revolution that would threaten them, for example that time when Russia was going to expand it's power in Greece by supporting, the revolutionaries but Metternich outwitted the tsar and his government.

Bismarck- The iron chancellor himself, famous for uniting Germany into a nation, with blood and iron, he had made the German empire into the strongest nation at the time. Prussia before Bismarck was constantly being dominated by Napoleon III and emperor Franz Joseph but when Bismarck came he instigated wars with all Denmark (who was currently being supported by the uk until the declared war on Prussia),France (basically the richest country in Europe) and Austria (who had a massive army). Bismarck dominated European politics until Kaiser Wilhelm II came and booted him out of office and Bismarck predicted that Germany would fall.

Ryu Seong-ryong: during this time, the Japanese invasion (the Imjin war) were happening.  Ryu Seong-ryong was the dominant politician and only thought of the people and not the King who was incompetent. Ryu Seong-ryong helped Admiral yi (who people say that he was on par or better than nelson) become head of the navy again, he predicted that the Japanese would invaded and urged the king to think about building defences, which were never built and he helped pass acts against the rich owning to much rice and the people were fed (by the way this was not passed for over a hundred years until Ryu Seong-ryong) he was a not bad general and he expanded the army.

For example, I think it could be argued that we would not have nearly the same level of local control over policies if not for the civil war. Since the war was largely about ""states rights,"" (including the ""right"" to own slaves) I think that when the Confederate states reentered the Union, the north was far less aggressive in its pursuit of central power.

34,"Why is Rome viewed as good, but later European Empires as bad?","To me I see a checklist of things which mirror the European Empires, yet Rome (and indeed most ancient civilsations) are not judged as harshly:

. Enslaved millions - check


. Viewed less advanced people as barbarians and held racist views against them - check


. Used their technology to violently expand their Empire - check


. Invented many technologies and warfare tactics - check


. contributed towards a philosophical age of enlightenment - check

We could be talking about literally any successful and ""enlightened"" Empire ever! It just occurs to me that European Empires are (rightly) viewed as oppressive and violent forces, yet Rome is viewed as a civilised and great society which was advancing the other civilisations rather than destroying them.

If we look at records Rome is responsible for a lot of cultural destruction. Torching the Nekromanteion in Greece, destroying Carthage, burning the Library of Alexandria (twice) etc. And the slavery is on an astronomical scale, one not seen by European powers until the Trans atlantic slave trade. 

On a small scale we can look at individual tribes and see how their way of life was destroyed. The Lusitanians were a tribe from part of what is now Portugal. They were recorded as fighting with curved Falcatas and practicing strange dances to celebrat some form of custom.  Praetor Servius Galba defeated them and enslaved 20,000, killing 9000. Their culture would never be seen again. That is just one tribe from the Iberian Peninsula where many tribes lived. What about all of Gaul, Britain, Illyria, the Levant etc. Records also show that in the 1st century BC Rome had a stable slave population of 5 Million, which was being constantly replenished by new conquered people. Roman slavery was quite similar to Empire Age slavery in that the Slaves had no legal personhood and could be killed without any legal qualms. They also were put to work in mines. Slaves in the City of Rome had an average life expectancy of 17 years! Caesar once conquered a province of Gaul and sold all 55,000 inhabitants as slaves on the spot. 

They made up a whopping 10% of the population of the Empire. I am not even sure if there is a total number for the amount of Slaves that Rome accumulated over the years, but it would be incredibly huge. 

We also tend to (again rightly) cast the blame of the famines and political upheaval of modern ex-colonial Regions on the failings of the European Empires, and how they exploited the land. Could we not do the same for Empires such as Rome, where they left exploited lands in their wake which would not see stability for years?

41,"What ""Stranger than Fiction"" moments would work well in fiction?","I'm a writer, and I'm always on the lookout for new plot points, etc., that would work well in some of my stories. I'm starting to realize that history is a prime source of such plot points, so now I'm getting curious what's out there. 

For example, one little tidbit I have stored away is that of how viking longboats worked. From what I understand, at the time, the only seaside towns that were vulnerable to attack were those that had deepwater ports, as the only way to transport troops was by use of huge galleons, etc., that needed the harbor to anchor in. However, longboats were light and had a shallow draft, which meant they could land virtually anywhere and get hauled up onto the beach. This meant that, suddenly, every village with a shoreline was a target, which would have (undoubtedly) struck fear in the hearts of all.

I could see this sort of plot point working really well in, say, a Sci-Fi setting--e.g., the only means of Faster than Light travel is via slow, clunky, defensible stargates... that is, until an alien race develops small, fast, reliable hyperdrive. Now no one os safe!!!

From weapons, tanks, and even their battleships its a wonder how the japanese were able to continue the war till 1945 and the dropping of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some historians believe that when the United States had gotten involved after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese had sealed their fate and defeat was all but certain. But the fact that the japanese military was able to continue the war and was prepared to defend their homeland in case of an American amphibious invasion despite losing practically all of their pacific possessions perhaps is a testament to how fanatical the common Japanese soldier was. Is there any truth to these claims and are they substantial enough to prove that it was this fanaticism of their emperor and perhaps their hatred for the Americans that had pushed the Japanese army to such lengths?

During my youth, I heard the story of a barbarian king that , in order to get inside a city, pretended that he wanted to get burried in a christian graveyard, yet he did hide weapon in his coffin and jumped out of it and stormed the city.

It may sound familiar to many, as it was also in the season 3 of vikings, yet I did heard that story before and whn I saw that scene in vikings, it brought back memories.

I however can't find any infos or facts about it, which makes me wonder if it did happen or not or if I'm just doing a poor research job.

Since contemporary chroniclers can be untrustworthy, perhaps a modern interpretation of public records is best. Oh, and it can be about a culture at any time and place.

Update: My fault. I wasn't sufficiently specific. I'm not looking for eyewitness accounts or broad descriptions of daily life. Instead, I want the dry details.

78,The End of the Ottomans,"So I have reread Andrew Wheatcrofts book ""The Enemy at the Gate"" and I have learned a great many interesting tidbits from his research and overall opinions of the Ottomans.  Many people believed, and many still do, that the Ottomans had broken their backs after the Battle of Vienna in 1683.  Many believed that Christianity was able to finally, perhaps even decisively, defeat their age old enemy on the battlefield. That Christendom had triumphed over the vile ""Turk"" and it was Habsburgs god given right to be the bulwark against the ""evil asian hordes"". 

However, though I agree that Ottomans defeat at Vienna was decisive, it was only so for that campaign.  There would be several more wars against the Ottomans decades later and each would be as poorly planned as the last as many of the wars had indecisive outcomes. (Barring the most beloved Prince Eugene of Savoy) Even the genius of Prince Eugene of Savoy did not stop the Turks from trying their luck with the Austrians even after his death with the final war being in 1787-91.  The Ottoman Empire was still seen as the bogeyman in Austria and the Battle of Vienna at 1683 was the primary cause of this.  

So, my question is, with the new found evidence of the Ottoman Empire, is it still understandable to think that the Ottoman Empire's military strength and the fear caused by them really went away with their defeat at Vienna in 1683?  The Austrians continued to fear the Ottomans even when they had bigger fish to fry such as that of France to their west. ",history,1467520915,Joseon194,5,5,True,2016-07-03

I was hoping for some help identifying some of the objects and medals. 

The coolest thing he had thought was a piece of hardtack his grandfather kept from the Great War, over 100 years old!. 

We were wondering what the medals were for and what the translation is for the german pass/note?
Not sure whats in the box, its seems to be full of uniform accoutrements. They both served in the Canadian Army.

Any help would be greatly appreciated reddit!

51,Sacred Mountains and their importance across the world. Connecting the dots.,"Hello, I suppose the mounting information that i've researched so far has led to more questions rather than answers. I will try to make this brief... all the while hopefully conveying the gist of my problem. Ive always been fascinated with history and the mythology that proceeded it. In the last year i've dived in detail into Native American history, specifically the Utes. There creation stories, their mecca and flood myth all center around Pikes Peak in Colorado - known to them as Tavakaiv or Tabakaiv meaning ""Sun Mountain"". Im not going to go into the flood myth, or its creation story and the many similarities it has with other cultures around the world. No, i'm going to focus exclusively on the mountain, its descriptions and others just like it in many other ancient cultures I have researched so far.

The mountain was created right before the flood as the lesser spirits escaped into heaven leaving all the precious materials in one big heap at the doorway in the sky. This is how Pikes Peak was formed and gave way to the second evolution of mankind that lived on top of it until the flood waters receded. The mountain is considered the stairway to heaven, the physical manifestation of the Great Spirit himself. Lesser Spirits were said to descend from the mountain to interact with the Utes and teach them civilization. It was also a way the people could communicate with the Great Spirit. 

Lets not forget about the well known Mt Olympus that housed the Greek Gods that played a very similar role as that of the Utes in symbology and description. While in China Tai Shan is merely an exact replica of function and description as Pikes Peak. ""It is considered a deity itself and has been venerated by the Chinese as their most sacred peak"". We also have mount Ararat that is tied in with Abrahamic religions and cultures. There should be no surprise that the Sumerians have such ties to the mythical lands of Aratta (most likely Ararat and its surroundings). Mt Sinai and Mt Fuji also take there place here with reoccurring similarities.

There are many other civilizations that have built structures to perhaps represent these sacred mountains of the gods by means of pyramids in different parts of the world. It is of interesting note that son of An, Enlil (one of the chief Sumerian gods) was nicked named the Mountain and was the commander of Earth for the Anuna gods. It is also interesting to note that the Egyptians referred to the gods ether as Neteru or the gods of Annu. The mythos of Greek, Egyptian and other nearby cultures has been strongly suggested and traced back to the Sumer stories of old. This I can accept because of local. Whats hard for me to grasp is the similarities from one continent to the other. The same story keeps repeating itself over and over again. There are many important and sacred Peaks all over the world that hold very many similarities in purpose as well. The the primary and most important ones being the gateways to heaven are far less, yet just as abundant in traditions world wide.

Its far easier to see now how such an interpretation as the mother civilization or the lemur theory - which has given rise to Lumeria has been suggested with the current data we are aware of so far. As far as I can tell, there was indeed a root source for the stories that expanded and got adopted by other civilizations or a mother civilization in which its people conquered the world in one way or another. Last possibility I can see is that many of these civilizations were exposed to the same phenomena similar enough that they interpreted it the same way. I guess that is my problem, I am unsure of the answer, are these individual stories created separately or are they merely an adaptation of another culture? 

I know this has been brief with not much details, but I hope it gets the point across I am trying to make. Your opinion on the matter and its interpretation would be most welcoming.

Thank you,

-Mateo

17,What historically attested religions remained largely unchanged for thousands of years?,"This might be a silly question. The evidence I've come across generally suggests that religions were generally highly syncretic and subject to rapid change - especially in the aftermath of war or migration.

People often come up with somewhat sensationalist subjects such as ""What's the oldest religion of the world?"" that quickly turn into competitions between members of different faiths.

I'm particularly interested in comparing the longevity of various historically attested religions, including the ones that are currently still around.

For example, the Mesopotamian religions are attested from around 3500 BCE to 600 BCE, until they were gradually replaced by those of neighbouring cultures or started shifting towards king worship religions. The makeup of their polytheistic pantheon changed quite a few times, though.

The syncretic traditional Chinese religions are still around to this very day and date back to sources from at least 400 BCE (Tao Te Ching) and 150 CE (Buddhism in China), although they greatly declined in popularity in the 20th century.

The oral traditions of Judaism, in its various forms, go back to least 800 BCE, when parts of the population started transitioning away from the polytheistic Canaanite religions that are still referenced in the Tanakh. The most drastic changes likely occurred in the transition from early Temple Judaism (extinct) to Rabbinic Judaism, after the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans.",history,1465641144,KjellJagland,26,67,True,2016-06-11

The best generals were those who had previous field experience, they chose men who were mostly administrators (the equivalent of placing Horatio Gates in charge of the Southern Army by Congress in 1780).  

4.	  The campaign itself was flawed from the start; and the objectives were not clear; was Canada to be Annexed? Or was it to be considered liberated by British rule? The US annexation of Canada doesn‚Äôt seem likely because they simply didn‚Äôt have the troops to occupy the entire nation nor the navy to defend its ports.  The US Military was also in poor supply of regular troops and artillery for sieges of fortified areas.  Most offensive operations were conducted with Militia; who were unreliable and often left the field.

I'm not sure why lamb's quarters was abandoned (it's a pseudocereal, related to quinoa - and actually is still grown in Mexico^1 ).  Marshelder is a relative of ragweed, and apparently was abandoned for obvious reasons when an alternative presented itself.

Do we have any other examples of this happening in other areas where plants were independently domesticated?  Specifically, I'm interested in the earliest examples, and total replacement, to the point where the native domesticated plants would be abandoned.

4,What exactly happened 96 years ago in Versailles.(very long),"Attention, very long thread incoming.

Hello everyone, my name is Szabolcs and I'm a Hungarian history lover, so I'd like to tell some things about the peace treaties of Versailles, in fact, about one specific one, the Treaty of Trianon. Hopefully I'll be able to tell you some new things that you did not and hopefully I'm not breaking any rules. I think I'm not.

So, where to start...what is Trianon(simply, as we call it) to Hungarians. The Treaty of Trianon was a national tragedy for our country, if you say Versailles, probably every Hungarian will think about Trianon, if you say Romania, or WW1, or June 4th, every single Hungarian will think about Trianon. Its basically an open wound in the countrys heart that is still not patched up.

Yes yes yes, you could say, but Hungary was not a souvenir state back in the day, you should be happy that you got a country. Well, thats not actually true, from 1867 the Habsburg Empire was called Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and to be honest, in our long relationship, the hungarian nobles and estates were always able to save their rights against the Habsburgs. 

So yes, we now have our own state, but here comes the [tricky part.](http://www.hajdupress.hu/uploads/files/rovatok/itthun/szegyenletes-trianon-emlekezik-az-orszag/5750f97c11542_orig.jpg)
The link showes the borders of the new Hungarian state and the land that was taken from the old Kingdom of Hungary. The new Hungarian state lost more than half of its population (18,2 million in 1910, 7,6 million in 1920), and third of its land (328 660 km¬≤ in 1918, 93 075 km¬≤ in 1924). This might sound very dramatically, but most of the population was not hungarian at all. Romanians, Germans, Slovakians, Rusyns, Serbians, Croatians, our nation was a commonwealth basically.(because of the Ottoman wars, the southern-slavic population migrated to our lands, so did the germans to build up our economy and make big money. This was in the 18th century.)

Again, you could say, not a big deal, most of the population was not Hungarian, and this was the era of nationalism. Yes, you are right, but here comes the worst part of Trianon, more than 3,3 million Hungarians were living in an other country, lots of them in an area where the hungarian nationality is majority, and this caused problems for the Hungarian diaspora, I will talk about it later. 

But, there was a last opportunity in our mind to make the treaty a little bit better, the [red map.](http://tortenelemportal.hu/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/teleki-terkep-1.jpg) It was made by our delegation, and its red because its the best way to show it. Red makes it feel its the dominant colour. It was showing the Hungarian majorities in the map of the Hungarian Kingdom(without Croatia). In this map you can see there are lots of Hungarians in Transylvania, in Slovakia(nowadays called *Felvid√©k* by us) and in the southern border. This map would have helped us, and the Hungarians outside of our borders, but Edward Benes and his great politican skills, and also the late map showing was not enough, our nations future , and in fact Europes future was made in the Grand Trianon castle, in June 4th, 1920. 
And yes, Europes future aswell, because the hate towards *literally everybody* in our country started with this, and sadly, after almost a 100 years, it still has its affects, and I think that this treaty was one of the big points in us joining the Axis in WW2. Revanchism, huh?

One last word about the Hungarian diaspora, after WW2, the hungarians outside of our borders were beaten up, they were despised and not welcomed there, lots of families were cut in two, villages were cut in two, hell even Uncle Johhny's cow was cut in two. But looks like our nation, and our neighbour nations are getting more civilized, and we can live together without any hate. Sadly, Hungary still has some neo-nationalist group, but hopefully  a better and peaceful future is yet to come.

Sorry for being way too long, I hope you don't mind this thread. I do not want to hurt anybody with my words, I was trying to stay a little bit less Hungarian while I wrote this, to be as historically correct as I can, but I'm not a historian, just a student, who loves history. If you have any questions about the judgment of Trianon nowadays, or judgment about anything, I'll try my best to answer it. Thank you for reading!",history,1465019384,just_szabi,11,1,True,2016-06-04

45,Forgotten battles that shaped our world; The Battle of Fontenoy (841),"The battle of Fontenoy (841) was a pivotal battle engaged during the Carolingian War of Succession. This war was fought between Louis The Pious three surviving sons; Lothair I, Louis the German and Charles the Bald and directly led to the signing of the Treaty of Verdun (843) which in turn shaped much of mainland Europe to what it is this day.

The battle concluded the Carolingian War of Succession which consisted of 2 main parties; The Imperialists under leadership of Lothair I and the Divisionists under Louis the German and Charles the Bald. Louis the Pious wanted to split his Empire amongst his sons as was required by the Salic Law. Lothair who saw himself as the only rightful heir to the Empire was unhappy with his father‚Äôs decision and already declared his first civil war in the late 830‚Äôs only to be defeated during the Battle of Worms in 839. When Louis the Pious died on the 20th of June 840 Lothair saw his chance to try and claim the Imperial title anew. On the 24th of July 840 just a little more than a month after his fathers death Lothair declared his Imperium and war on his brothers Louis and Charles. The war eventually culminated into the Battle of Fontenoy, which was fought on the 25th of June 841 in the Fontenoy commune , France. This massive engagement of which some sources estimate around 150,000 men on each side ended with a total rout on the side of Lothair I and his allies ( mainly Pippin II whom Lothair had promised the total control of Aquitaine). Although the battle did not conclude the War of Succession immediately, it is seen by most historians as the main reason to the conclusion of the war. On the 12th of February 842 Louis the German and Charles the Bald would sign the Oath of Strasbourg which stated an alliance between the two brothers and pledged solidarity to oppose their eldest brother Lothair.  Lothair recognizing that his attempts to fight his brothers was only making them more united, started engaging in peace negotiations around June of 842. These negotiation would eventually lead to the signing of the Treaty of Verdun in August 843. The treaty divided the Empire in 3 pieces; 

- Charles the Bald would receive the western portion of the Empire, which later would become France. (Pepin II was granted the kingdom of Aquitaine, but only under the authority of Charles.).
- Louis the German received the eastern portion. Louis was guaranteed the kingship of all lands to the east of the Rhine and to the north and east of Italy, which was called East Francia. This kingdom would be the building block of the Holy Roman Empire.
- Lothair received the central portion of the empire which later became, from north to south: the Low Countries, Lorraine, Alsace, Burgundy, Provence, and the Kingdom of Italy (which covered only the northern half of the Italian Peninsula), collectively called Middle Francia or Lotharingia.

When Lothair died on the 29th of September 855 he divided his Kingdom between his 3 sons, although large swaths of these land North of the Alps would be swallowed up by West- and East Francia.

2,Visual history request! I'm looking for visual representations of eras.,"Hopefully I'm posting this in the proper subreddit, I am looking for a visual representation of an era, preferably a pattern but I'm open minded. I have 3 eras in mind already but more are welcome. They are: the industrial revolution, the renaissance, and Ancient Rome/the Roman Empire. 

For example interwoven gears and cogs representing the industrial revolution. Why do I want these pictures/patterns? Well, tldr: for a tattoo. Please let's not turn this into anything other than a fun discussion/caricature of different eras.   I am getting the Latin phrase ""finis coronat opus"" which means ""the end crowns the work"" tattooed on my right arm in a band shape around the circumference of my upper forearm. To me it means all the hard work, blood, sweat, and tears you put into something will be made worth it by the out come. I don't want boring script, because that wouldn't be any work and the outcome wouldn't be cool. My thought is each word gets it's own division of the band and surrounding it is a pattern or something that represents an era of struggle or toil that in the end was worth it because it had a great out come. Like the industrial revolution paved the way for modern technology, during the Renaissance painter worked for years on paintings that still influence artists to this day. (The Mona Lisa was a 16 year undertaking if I'm not mistaken).

48,I just realized that the Japanese plan to defeat the US in WWII is essentially just them trying to repeat their strategy for the Russo-Japanese War.,"It's not like this is some amazing revelation or something, but it's an effective way of understanding their decision to attack the US. No one ever explained it to me in school this way and I feel like it would go a long way in helping people realize that the Japanese were not just madmen.

In the Russo-Japanese War the Japanese surprise attacked the Russian Far East fleet at harbor without a declaration of war and mostly destroyed it. The Russians then had to send their Baltic Fleet all the way around Africa, wasting tons of resources, just to have the fleet be annihilated as soon as it reached Japan. The massive loss of resources and their navy, a shaky situation on land, and the desire to end what was already an embarrassing situation, all caused the Russians to sue for peace.

The Japanese in WWII envisioned a repeat of their still-recent memories of the Russo-Japanese war. A surprise attack, crippling the distant enemies fleet and only means of threatening the home islands. Wait and plan a trap for the counter-attack. Destroy the majority of the US fleet and sue for peace in a strong position.

In hindsight and with accurate info on US war capabilities (and willingness to fight)*, it was a terrible idea that simply didn't line up with reality. The USA's ability to replace the considerable losses the Japanese inflicted mostly precluded the possibility of the US seeking peace due to naval losses. The US navy also proved to be superior to the Japanese in pitched battle which prevented the Japanese from ever reaching their strong bargaining position.

Still, I feel like this way of explaining their decision-making allows people to more accurately understand the nuances of the situation. Otherwise, many people just resort to calling the Japanese crazy or brainwashed when really, they had some rational reasons for believing they could pull it off.  They had done it before and, since their victory over Russia, they had known nothing but victory after victory. It is very easy to become overconfident when you never seem to fail and they never had an accurate picture of American Industrial capacity (and willingness to fight)* to temper their bravado.

If I'm an idiot for just realizing this then at least I'm pretty sure I'm not the only idiot out there who never connected the dots. My History teachers never mentioned the Russo-Japanese war to begin with haha.",history,1464469976,thewalkingfred,281,1118,True,2016-05-28

But, of course I'm hearing that some of these details are quite different/incorrect and/or in the wrong order.

15,Questions about writing fictional history and learning about early modern Europe (x-post),"Right now I am trying to write a fictional history of a country in an alternative europe. I am interested in the period from 1600-1914. I'll probably read about the world wars when I'm done with my other reading. I'm not exactly sure if those are the exact areas I should be studying, but I believe they are. My goal is to get a decent knowledge of those centuries in Europe so I can write a history that is mostly realistic with as few as possible anachronisms. any suggestions for other things that would aid me in achieving those goals are welcome.        

The ideas I have for the nation's history so far is that it is a utopia of sorts, it developed into a democracy rather than a monarchy during the middle ages, and that it became an enlightened absolutist regime in the 17th or 18th century, and that absolutist regime continues to the present day. There's supposed to be a sort of hero worship over the nation's founders, in similar vein to how traditionally americans loved their country's founders. Perhaps more like the Turkish culture, where the founder defines politics.

I ask this because I live in a republic in Asia which was ruled by a dictator during the late 60's to mid 80's. During that time, the country was placed under Martial Law - wanton cruelty, violation of human rights, extra-judicial killings, torture and corruption became widespread. To date, the money stolen by the regime is still missing (billions of dollars in ill-gotten wealth).

It just so happened that the dictator was ousted and so was his family in 1986. They went to exile in the US.

After the dictator died, his family eventually came back to the country and, within their province, regained their political clout. Immediate family members and relatives would become mayors, governors, congressmen, senators.

And now, his son is leading the polls and is poised to win the election for vice presidency in a couple of days.

So yes, do you folks know of a similar instance wherein something like this has happened?

---------

NOTE: For those who haven't guessed yet, the dictator in this story is Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines; and the man now poised to become the next vice president is his son.

Polish control of Danzig became the ultimate problem. After 1945, Germany lost even more land plus all German speakers erased from former Prussian and Austrian territories.

In Treaty of Versailles, military limitations imposed on Germany and foreign troops in Rhineland were also considered insulting by German. After 1945, NATO and Soviet troops were everywhere and roaming freely in the two Germany. Nazi offensive weapons and WMDs were all looted or destroyed by other nations.

The only difference was probably the economy. By Treaty of Versailles, Germany needed to pay almost all the taxation to other countries for compensation purpose so the economy was very bad when other countries were recovering quickly in the early 1920s. After 1945, while there were compensations to the victims of Nazi Germany, American invested on rebuilding half of Germany but it could still be considered humiliating because the economy was now completely controlled by foreign investors although they could feed some mouth.

17,I want to check if you guys are interested in a AMA with my grandmother. She survived the Japanese concentration camps in Indonesia during WWII.,"Hi all!

Last year I've seen a lot of redditors that let their grandparents have an AMA, mostly about their experiences in WWII, but these stories are always from the Europian/Western side. Although very interesting I've always felt that the Asian side isn't told that much. At least in my case, we Dutchies learn almost nothing about the history and culture of our former colonies like Indonesia. Such imporant things happend there, but people simply don't know anything about them.

My grandmother was born in Indonesia during the '30, so I was lucky she could tell me wonderful stories (relatively, of course) about everything she's experienced. The struggles during the war: being a half-blood she and her entire family ended up in one of the concentration camps during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. After that her immigration to the Netherlands: she was kicked out of her homeland and had to move to a new and strange country where they didn't exactly get welcomed, they barely spoke the language of, and had to survive with almost no posessions.

I thought her life-story might give a unique angle on the past and if you guys would find it interesting I could arrange an AMA on /r/IAmA/. Let me hear your thoughts! 

**EDIT:** Wow the response was much greater than I first anticipated, thanks for your feedback! I'll speak with my grandmother about this and I'll arrange the AMA!

58,Was the Italian campaign necessary?,"Edit:forgot tormenting WW2 in the title.

Now I'll start off by saying I've not studied the Italian campaign too intensely so here we go.

Whilst it was obviously necessary to secure the Mediterranean Sea and thus capture Sicily and blockading all the ports surely this campaign was just for the sake if vanity to satisfy Stalin. Churchills ""soft underbelly of Europe"" was anything but. All the generals etc should have been well against campaigning in a thin,mountainous country. It was never going to go well.
That use of resources must have surely delayed D-Day by months whilst not really doing anything to speed up the war. You could argue it tied down some of hitlers armies but the allied cost was surely not worth this.

Additionally, surely a country like Italy must be perfect for Guerilla warfare, would increased help for the partisans have been more useful?

I would think that the countries with European settlers would make the decolonization process the easiest due to the fact that they are apart of or come from countries comprising the UN, thus having the same goals in mind.

From the research I have done so far, these areas are all open to debate. For example, some (like Chernow) have said that Hamilton was an abolitionist, while others have noted that Eliza owned slaves herself. Because of this, there are sure to be different views and different sources for each topic.

The items up for discussion include:

-Hamilton's views on minorities (slaves and women -- others?)
-Hamilton's sexuality (John Laurens)
-Hamilton's death (was it death by Burr or was it suicide?)

55,History of the hemophilia HIV epidemic,"Hey, r/history! Recently I've been studying a lesser-known history of the early years of HIV/AIDS, and thought I'd share a bit about what I've been reading and solicit some feedback. 

The history of HIV/AIDS in the gay community is pretty widely explored, but there's relatively little written on the parallel infection of the blood supply in general and the hemophilia epidemic in particular. In the U.S. alone, 10,000 people with hemophilia were infected even as government agencies, patient advocacy orgs, blood banks, and pharmaceutical companies all failed to act on increasingly compelling evidence that HIV could be communicated through blood products and medication. Thousands of donors' blood was combined into each vial of antihemophilic clotting factor, with very poor cleaning and screening processes protecting the final product. Unbeknownst to most hemophilia patients, the very medicine they believed was saving their lives was also infecting them with HIV. Through all of this, the National Hemophilia Foundation's medical team and local clinics all over the country told patients to continue their treatment and at times even directly contradicted the data and evidence they were discussing behind closed doors. Government agencies, doctors, and manufacturers were faced with a terrible choice: the alternative medical choices to human factor were all inconvenient and less effective. Life before modern hemophilia medications was painful and all too brief, and no one wanted to go back to those days. Furthermore, there were deep disagreements about the data surrounding HIV and at first very few actors realized just how deadly the disease would be or how badly the blood supply could be compromised. However, the blood industry and the various organizations which enabled them attempted to cover up the truth and drag their feet in securing the blood supply long after such arguments could excuse their behavior. It's also indisputable that patients were not informed of the risks and adequate safeguards which could have been implemented earlier were not adopted until the industry was caught red-handed. To this day, arguments about guilt and motivation rage on between patients, doctors, and corporations inside the community. I personally believe that some infection was inevitable given how vulnerable the hemophilia population was, but I also believe that corporations and the FDA made the epidemic far worse than it had to be out of self-interest, greed, and a desire not to upset the status quo. 

In the end, the research that the CDC put together on hemophiliacs definitively proved the link between HIV transmission and bodily fluids (which was previously unknown) and led to the infamous Red Cross ban on gay men donating blood. And the fact that so many straight ""innocent"" men and boys developed the disease profoundly changed the way that American society treated HIV/AIDS and its victims, and even began to lift the stigma surrounding the disease (even though hemophilia patients who took contaminated meds still suffered from intense discrimination, violence, and harassment). Tragically, it seems like those responsible did not learn from their mistakes. These patients were not treated any better by the public/private medical system during the aftermath than they were during the epidemic. A recall was not issued until 1989, and the government did not use their database of infected citizens who donated blood to identify hemophilia patients who may have used infected medication until 1991. About 40% of the wives of these patients (hemophiliacs are almost always men) became infected, in part because of the slow response. A class action suit was unsuccessful at gaining reparations, and in the end the community had to settle for two compassionate payments: one from the government, and one from the factor industry. Neither admitted any wrongdoing, and each payment amounted to the cost one year's worth of hemophilia and HIV medication (around $100,000). The recalled medications themselves were sold at a discount to other parts of the world desperate for hemophilia relief, often with no documentation that indicated which lots of medicine were contaminated and which were clean. When America invaded Iraq in 2003, the military found people with hemophilia imprisoned alongside political dissidents, the victims of a regime desperate to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS at all costs.

This subject is very important to me, because I have hemophilia and was born not long after these events. I cannot overstate how profoundly this crisis shaped the hemophilia community and changed the men and women who lived through it. More to the point, I believe that this iatrogenic catastrophe cannot be written off as one-time mishap or dismissed as a subject for serious reflection and inquiry. What happened to the hemophilia community offers sobering lessons about medical safety and cautions against the worst impulses that government and industry face when healthcare is treated as a private business rather than a public good. Right now I'm only doing an independent study on this topic, but I hope to expand it to a senior thesis. I'm mostly using secondary sources that have been written on the subject (the book *Blood Saga* is a great starting point), but I've also found a few robust primary sources. These include the final report by the Institute of Medicine on these events, a copy of a community document called *The Trail Of Aids* (a big compilation of government and industry memos, reports, and minutes that were obtained during one of the lawsuits), and a handful of issues of a newsletter called The Common Factor that was written for and by infected men with hemophilia.

62,What was everyday life like in a medieval castle?,"I've been wanting to write a Short-Fiction story that takes place in a large castle in the middle ages.  But, I also like learning about history (I'm still a pretty big novice, though), and I am genuinely curious to learn about what ""castle life"" was like back then, regardless of whether I end up using my newfound knowledge for writing a story or not.

And, my interests are not necessarily limited to English castles - I'd be just as curious about mainland-European castles in areas like where current-day Germany or France or etc are located (since, from what little I know so far, I think some of the biggest/best castles were in those areas, and not just in the English Isles area).

Also, I think I am particularly curious about the lifestyle within the ""upper-normal"" types of castles (as in: NOT a ""Royal Palace"", but rather, just more like the ""non-royal"" castles, if there was such a thing) but preferably on the larger side of the size/grandiosity spectrum, to where there were hundreds of staff, clergy, nobility, guests, etc etc in and around the castles at all times, during their normal day-to-day run of things.

Here are some examples of things I'd be curious to learn about, in regards to castle-life:

- What was the population-demographic (of the castle) like?  I.e. how many servants were there relative to the total population of the castle?  What about clergy?  Lookouts/guards?  Nobility?  Guests?  Other? (especially in a large castle with as much as perhaps several hundred total people living in, or directly-associated to the castle on a daily basis)

- What kinds of foods might they have eaten (I realize this would vary depending on whether it was an English castle or Germanic or Frankish or whatever, and also from sub-region to sub-region), so, maybe that wasn't too good of a question, but still wonder about sort of the logistics of it, like if there were certain types of food that they generally preferred, due to being able to make large feast-like meals of it to serve the entire castle-population at once, for the main meal of the day, like gigantic vats of soup/stew, or huge roasts of large animals, or what, etc.

- What was the toilet/sewage system (if any) usually like?  I.e. where/what-into did they poop and pee, and where/how did it get moved away from the castle (if at all).  And did the protocols vary in regards to this depending on whether which hierarchical class the person belonged (nobility/clergy/military/peasant/guests/etc)

- Did they tend to have any daily, or weekly, or monthly, or whateverly ""rituals"" or ""traditions"" that were specific to castle-life, or maybe not specific just to castles, but of the era, that would normally have been going on in these castles on a fairly regular basis.  I don't know what type of thing it might be, but maybe something weird and kind of formal/traditional that a time traveler would be all like ""whoa wtf is going on up in hurrrr..."" type of reaction when seeing it happen for the first time?

- Were there any well known types of superstitions particular to castles that tended to pervade in most large castles (i.e. ""don't spill the candle wax on the hallway floor, or a ghost will haunt the corridors for 7 days and 7 nights thereafter"" or some superstition-ey types of stuff like that, which were relevant to ""castle life""?  Preferably ones where the same exact or nearly-exact type of superstition existed in a whole bunch of different castles across a country/countries, as like a ""castle thing"", or something.

- Were there any activities or behaviors that were considered really bad manners or poor form to be doing inside a castle (and/or maybe stuff which most, or a significant-minority of them still did anyway, in secret, even though it was something you ""weren't supposed to do"" in a medieval castle in general)?

- What were the most common, or popular, or interesting forms of punishment that were used inside these types of castles (or different types depending on what hierarchical class the offender belonged to, maybe?)  What would've been some common things people got punished for?  What types of equipment or setups did they use?  Did large portions of the castle population ""participate"" in the administering of the punishment, or just the guards, or a special punisher-guy (maybe the same guy as the executioner, if they had one?) etc?

- When did they tend to go to bed, and when did they tend to get up in the morning?  (I assume it would depend on which hierarchical class they belonged to within the castle hierarchy, but not sure).  Also, I assume that maybe they stayed up later on certain nights, like if they had an equivalent version of ""Friday Nights"" or something, or a very regularly-recurring holiday type of thing, where the night before it, they partied/stayed up later etc.  I'm particularly curious about the LESS formal/annual-only types of bigtime ""holidays"" but more like, something more equivalent to a ""friday night"" in modern-day equivalency, (if there was such a thing/such an equivalent, that is)

- Would there have been lots of flags, or very large/tall flags/flagpoles on most of these castles?  Or huge banners or coats of arms on the exterior and/or interior of these castles?

- What were the lookout-posts/sentries/guards/military-security situations typically like (not during formal ""war"" time, but like, in more ordinary periods of castle life).  Did they sound a horn, or ring a huge bell or something if an unexpected party of guests was approaching from off in the distance?  Send a meeting-force to go ""meet them at the gate""?  Everyone in the castle freak out and become glued to the windows?  Everyone be non-chalant/HAF about it like nbd?  I feel like I need to know more about this whole aspect.

- Did a lot of these castles really actually have a moat and a drawbridge?  And if they did, did they really put alligators/crocodiles and stuff like that into said moats?  Or is that more of a fable-vibe type of thing and not how it usually was like in real life?

- Did they usually have pets (none?  small amount-but-only-for-nobility?  Tons, roaming all around?) inside or around the castle?  I.e. dogs, cats, etc?

- Did most castles tend to have really bad issues with infestations a lot of the time (cockroaches, rodents, bedbugs, fleas, ticks, bats, etc)?  And if so, was there any type of proactive measures they tended to try to take to avoid said infestations, or to try to mitigate them to some extent?  Or, after-the-fact did they take any formal/semi-formal attempts at getting rid of said infestations once they occurred?  Would most of the castle residents be so used to it that they tended to have a casual attitude about it, like not jump up and down and yell and shriek if a mouse ran across their lap while they were eating dinner or lying in bed, or was it something they spazzed about the same way we do nowadays?

- Did most large castles contain a ""library"" or ""library-room""?

- What about other specific dedicated-room types of rooms?  I.e. an indoor ""theater"" room, or dart-throwing room, or communal-bathing room, or cards/table-game playing room, or anything like that?  And if they did, or if it was only for the upper-class members of the hierarchy, were there any smaller/crappier equivalent rooms/gathering-places for the members of the lower classes, where they hung out/did stuff all in a specific room (prior to going off to their sleeping quarters or whatever, or was that pretty much it for them, like they did any ""stuff"" they were gonna do, in said ""sleeping quarters""?

- Was there much weed smoking going on in any, most, or all of these big European castles during the middle ages?  What about any other drugs (other than alcohol, I mean).  Psychedelic mushrooms maybe?  Some natural plant-form of uppers, downers, or opiates maybe?

- What was the prostitute situation like in castles?  Did any of them actually live inside the castle itself?  Or did they just live nearby and come in as guests (or secretly get hurried in through the rear entrance, if it was considered shameful/taboo?), or were there not really any hookers in these sorts of castles for the most part?

- Not sure what my question in regards to homosexuality would even be, in regards to castles, other than just figuring that it would be even tougher for homosexuals to have their sex with it going unnoticed, given the physical confines/layout of the castle-setting, so, I guess if there was any interesting historical facts/theories about homosexual lifestyle within a large castle, I'd be curious to hear about it, or anything interesting there is to know about it in regards to castles during medieval times.  (I assume it was considered taboo/not allowed, but no clue whether it was like EXTRA severely not allowed in a castle compared to the regular country outside the castle, or LESS severely not allowed/authority-figures ""looked the other way"" about it, or what the whole vibe tended to be like about it.  (Also, if there was anything noteworthy to mention in terms of the differences between man-on-man homosexuality vs woman-on-woman homosexuality, in a castle, if this is relevant/noteworthy in some way maybe)

- Were there any specific sexual fetishes that seemed to occur at an unusually high rate (relative to the overall country population/culture in the overall land of the country rather than just specifically the castles themselves), as a result of living that ""castle lifestyle""?  Like, more bondage, or whipping, or I don't even know what exactly, but some sort of well known castle-specific sexual fetishes that were considered an open-secret in ""castle culture"" or something?

- What about general nudity?  (Not just in a sexual context).  Were the attitudes and/or everydayish-opportunities about males seeing other males naked, females seeing other females naked, and most importantly, males seeing females naked or females seeing males naked, in castle life, that were different in any way than non-castle life in the same regions in the same eras?  Like, did the confined-quarters aspect of large amounts of people all living in the same building, have any notable effects in regards to nudity, and what they thought about it/how they handled it/what types of nudity-related scenarios were going down on the reg, etc?

In the United States, nativism has a long history. For a while Benjamin Franklin was hostile to Germans in colonial Pennsylvania. Nativism gained its name from the ""Native American"" parties of the 1840s and 1850s. In this context ""Native"" does not mean indigenous or American Indian but rather those descended from the inhabitants of the original Thirteen Colonies. It impacted politics in the mid-19th century because of the large inflows of immigrants after 1845 from cultures that were different from the existing American culture.

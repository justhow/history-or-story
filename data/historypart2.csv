How?(other subs/askhistorians couldn't help me)","So my girlfriend is writing her thesis on some art history stuff and she stumbled upon some piece of info which states that a certain guy that was publishing his art magazine at around 1922 , was often asking for cliches from other people in order to print stuff on it.   
1) Does that mean he had to get a metal plate every time he wanted to post a picture of an artwork in his magazine?    
2) Does that mean that the picture has always to be posted in the size that the metal plate has and that he can't change that and he just has to fit the size wherever possible in the magazine?   
Then it was somewhere stated that after many times of use the quality of the picture was worse.   
3) Does that mean that after using it consecutively the cliche ""wore off"" ?    
4)Also how can the artworks be transferred to a cliche(aka a metal plate) and look accurate as they do? I mean they are detailed , with shadows and everything. How was that achieved?

94,Why did it take so long for (German)POW to be released after WWII?,"I was doing some reading on German POW in WWII and i started to wonder why it took years to release all the POW after the war.  
  
I know that the majority of POW was released pretty quickly after the war ended (within a few month), which was easy taking into account most of them became POW and held in camps inside Germany. (Like the camps along the Rhine containing up to about 2 million POW)  
  
I did some further reading and got some numbers.  
In 1947 the allies held a meeting discussing the actions to be taken for the remaining POW and reporting the following numbers:  
  
* UK: 435,295  
* France: 631,483  
* USA: 30,976  
* Soviet Union: 890,532  
* Sum: 1,988,286  
  
They agreed on releasing all of them not later than the end of 1948. The last 10,000 (rounded) POW have finally been released in 1955 (10 years after the war) from soviet captivity.  
  
I also checked the conventions about treatment of POW and found the Hague Convention, in effect at the end of the war, stating in art. 20:  
&gt;After the conclusion of peace, the repatriation of prisoners of war shall take place **as speedily as possible**.  
  
and the 3rd Geneva Convention, in effect since 1950, stating in art. 118:  
&gt;Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated **without delay** after the cessation of active hostilities. [...]  
  
I get that you need a lot of organisation and logistics to deal with such a great number of people and i get that POW are not the top priority (you want to send your own soldiers back home, the establishment of an administration, identifying and arresting of war criminals...) but i don't get why it would take up to 3 years (and longer) to manage the release.  
  
So, my questions: What took them so long? Has there been some kind of protest at the time or any time after (maybe by a neutral state or an organisation like the red cross) demanding the POW to be released? Has there ever been any justification for violating the agreements signed by all parties involved?

10,Medieval Warfare,"Medieval Warfare still stands as one of the most unknown areas of military history in my repertoire but I have periodically gotten interested in it as time went on because of Game of Thrones and reading Song of Ice and fire.  A couple of questions:

Was heavy cavalry, that of heavily armored knights such as in France and England, the primary deciding force within a Medieval army?  From what I have heard and read, heavy cavalry was considered the trump card for any medieval army due to the rest of the army being made up of, primarily, peasantry who were not trained to withstand a charge from heavily armored knights. 

How did the lords and kings go about mobilizing their armies?  I'm guessing they would just put the call out in their fiefdoms and gather their men and then march them to wherever the king decided to make a rendezvous point

When knights fought on foot, would they only use sword and shield?  I have seen this often in movies but I can't help but feel that is inaccurate because Samurai, who were considered the Japanese equivalent of knights, usually specialized in a certain weapon and only used the katana as a sidearm.  It, to me, makes sense that a European knight would specialize in another weapon as it seems that a medieval long sword or arming sword would be hard to use in close quarters with hundreds of other men swinging around them

I have heard from my professor that medieval warfare was usually only fought during the war season (summer and spring) as when it when winter came around, the armies would withdraw and then return again when the snows melted.  Is that true? 

I know the Kings were considered to be the commanders in chief of their respective armies but did Medieval era armies have clear-cut ranks for their rank-and-file and officers?  Like I know some lords would probably have a certain political rank in court but would that rank also carry over during campaign and hold the same magnitude?

What were tactics and formations like in Medieval Warfare?  Usually I have seen that many medieval armies were split up in three:  the vanguard, the center, and the rear. Would they usually send in the van to soften the enemy up and send in the center and the rear to destroy the rest.  Was this considered to be the typical formation within Medieval armies?

I just started getting into hiking and what I'm reading about long hikes (anywhere from a few days to a few months) is that they require a lot of preparation, skills, and materials.

I understand that they were both highly qualified and skilled for the journey, but nature can throw curveballs that even experts have a hard time overcoming. I don't know for a fact, but I would guess that today's hiking professionals would have a rough time doing what Lewis and Clark did with the materials that were available at the time. So, I guess basically my question is:

First post in /r/history/ here for me, so fit here are any corrections or things that need to me modified for format, please let me know. Thanks!

First off, this no a do my homework for me question. I'm doing a project and this made me genuinely curious.

I'm researching the ""Piegan Massacre of the Blackfeet Indians in January of 1870 - also sometimes called the Baker Massacre, or the Marias Massacre.
[Quick Wiki Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marias_Massacre)

This massacre was to quell the threat, and sometimes isolated indebtedness of violence, as well as the (arguably justifiable) unpredictable or violent Indian tribes of the Blackfoot confederacy in Montana as the Homestead act and discovery of gold brought in more and more Whites.

The Piegan Massacre was not taken well within the general public as far as I can tell due to the fact that the number reported by the government Indian agent included:

*33 men

*15 ""young and fighting men (between 15-37 years old)

*18 between the ages of 37 and 80

*8 aged between 60 and 70

*90 women, and 50 children between 12 years and younger

*Please forgive the longer intro*

**TL;DR: US Army lead by a Colonel and orders from a General massacred over 200 Indians in January 1980 to help wane and control the Indians where Whites were moving into**

*Finally* to the root of my question. I have found one source so far that says 
&gt;""There had been strong oppositionto the army officers on thepartof reformelements as well. Themassacre of Piegan Idians by the part of the reform under Col. E. M.Baker on January 23, 1970, an action approved by General Sheridan, caused a gread humanitarian outcry."" 

*American Indian Policy in Crisis: Christian Reformers and the Indian 1865 - 1900, by Francis Paul Prucha

***
FINALLY, THE BEDROCK OF MY QUESTION!

1. Was the more public outcry than I can typically find in these books than there is presented to be, and not just in the Piegan massacre but the massacres happening across the state. What kind of public outcry was there and what shape could that have taken form? If it ended up being such a normal thing did public outcry really matter. After all, this is with the intent that the United States military is keeping the citizens safe.
2. Were these kind of attacks and raids and battles on the edges, trail ending, etc, of the Indian wars still comma?",history,1459081527,nos4autoo,16,10,True,2016-03-27

I'd prefer to focus on domestic US history - such as television/suburbanization in the 1950s, 1960s counterculture, Great Society, the Nixon shock, stagflation in the 1970s, conservatism in the 1980s, the Republican Revolution of 1994, etc.

I recently started poking around in our family history and amazingly my grandpa just handed me a collection of ca. 150 photos his father Kurt took during his entire military career.

62,"A few years ago, I found out my great uncle had won a medal of honor in the Philippines and had a book written about him.","His name was John R. McKinney, usually going by JR. My grandma married his brother Jack after divorcing my grandpa, and I had never met that part of the family because most of them were dead before I was born, with my great uncle dying when I was around 9. My grandmother was dead by the time I learned about the medal of honor story, with the only one I could talk to about it being my mother who remembered him as a really quiet backwoodsy man. A really nice guy from what I've heard, and he pretty well refused to talk about his war days. 

I heard that some film requests were made back in the 50s or 60s, but his sister made him refuse. He had never even had a girlfriend before he left, and she felt they would turn his life into a big fake drama when he was just a country boy that grew up hunting squirrels before volunteering. He ended up having a local highway named after him. The book interviewed some family members, I read it and actually did a paper on it in one of my senior classes for my bachelor's in history.  It seems kinda sensationalized to me (The title is literally ""Phantom Warrior: The Heroic True Story of Pvt. John McKinney's One-Man Stand Against the Japanese in World War II."") but it's interesting in its depictions of life behind the front lines and what kind of trouble people got up to, since he spent much of the war working at supply bases in New Guinea before he was shipped to combat in the Philippines.  Anyway, here's the citation:

McKinney, John R.

Rank and organization: Sergeant (then Private), U.S. Army, Company A, 123d Infantry, 33d Infantry Division

Place and date: Tayabas Province, Luzon, Philippine Islands, May 11, 1945

Entered service at: Woodcliff, Georgia


""The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Sergeant John R. McKinney, United States Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action above and beyond the call of duty on 11 May 1945, while serving with Company A, 123d Infantry Regiment, 33d Infantry Division, in action at Tayabas Province, Luzon, Philippine Islands. Sergeant McKinney fought with extreme gallantry to defend the outpost which had been established near Dingalan Bay. Just before daybreak approximately 100 Japanese stealthily attacked the perimeter defense, concentrating on a light machinegun position manned by three Americans. Having completed a long tour of duty at this gun, Private McKinney was resting a few paces away when an enemy soldier dealt him a glancing blow on the head with a saber. Although dazed by the stroke, he seized his rifle, bludgeoned his attacker, and then shot another assailant who was charging him. Meanwhile, one of his comrades at the machinegun had been wounded and his other companion withdrew carrying the injured man to safety. Alone, Private McKinney was confronted by ten infantrymen who had captured the machinegun with the evident intent of reversing it to fire into the perimeter. Leaping into the emplacement, he shot seven of them at pointblank range and killed three more with his rifle butt. In the melee the machinegun was rendered inoperative, leaving him only his rifle with which to meet the advancing Japanese, who hurled grenades and directed knee mortar shells into the perimeter. He warily changed position, secured more ammunition, and reloading repeatedly, cut down waves of the fanatical enemy with devastating fire or clubbed them to death in hand-to-hand combat. When assistance arrived, he had thwarted the assault and was in complete control of the area. Thirty-eight dead Japanese around the machinegun and two more at the side of a mortar 45 yards distant was the amazing toll he had exacted single-handedly. By his indomitable spirit, extraordinary fighting ability, and unwavering courage in the face of tremendous odds, Private McKinley saved his company from possible annihilation and set an example of unsurpassed intrepidity.""


Wish I could say more about him, since I didn't know him. I probably did meet him at some family gathering when I was too young to really know who he is. But I thought it was a neat story. IIRC, the sword actually cut most of his ear off.

38,"How important was music, singing, musical instruments and ritual in the battlefield before the 20th century?","In pre-world war 1 battlefields, battlefield music, battlefield signals with instruments, generally intimidation, singing, war cries, etc. all seem to have been very prevalent. The [Celtic Carnyx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVAWwWi0DbE) for instance, classic fife and drums from later gunpowder eras, etc.

Battlefield seemed like a ritual and it seems to have been unusual for battles to not have an element of music, shouting, singing or boasting. The Spartans were silent during battle apparently and this was seen as something strange to the rest of the Greeks, who would make a huge noise before entering battle, banging on shields, hurling insults, etc. 

However, in movies and videogames, battles are almost always silent affairs. In the Last Kingdom, the new series, there's no preparation, no music, no raising of spirits or songs sung, the two armies just meet and one army just charges at the other, with very little cohesion, sense of comradery or honour and especially no sense of ritual. No single combat challenges are issued, the commanders don't send out riders to greet each other, there's no sense of pride in the combat that's about to unfold, and we know battles were a source of tremendous importance despite how scarce they were because of how much is written about them. There's no musicians playing, it's cold, emotionless and seems a little jarring. 

The Last Kingdom isn't an exception, most battles in movies seem like violent, brutal, empty affairs.

This is also true of videogames like Total War, where there isn't a sense of ritual in the combat, no musicians or singing, it's just brutal killing.

**How significant was music, musical instruments for signalling, singing and especially the whole sense of ritual to the battlefields from Ancient Times to the 20th century and how did this change over time?**

53,"My thoughts on ""Vietnam: A History"" by Stanley Karnov","When you come across any history on the Vietnam War, the general consensus is that the war was a spectacular failure due to many Americans' reckless behavior on enemy lines, in addition to a weak South Vietnam compared to its stronger Northern cousin. The war was a combination of problems, including the murders of many Vietnamese civilians (from mothers to young children) at the hands of Americans, the suicide of Diem in the aftermath of a complicated reign, and the struggles of Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon to handle the American front. The war was considered beyond anyone's control, this being one of many reasons that antiwar movements around the nation protested for America to bring its troops home. Upon withdrawal (and incidents including Johnson throwing in the towel by refusing to run for a reelection and Nixon having to resign in disgrace due to his aggressive attitude and his primary role in the Watergate scandal), America was no longer seen as the unstoppable superpower that it was during the era of World War II but a flawed nation that interferes in other nations' conflicts only to make relations worse between conflicting parties and their interactions with America. 

I picked up Karnov's *Vietnam: A History* a few days ago because I wanted to gain a better understanding of everything that took place rather than the limited information that came from media. I was expecting the work to have some time dedicated to some of the battles that took place, and while this book doesn't do a great job at the describing the battles, its descriptions of what happened behind the scenes with politicians and leaders are decently written. The book takes time to explain the overall arc of the war, starting with the conflicts between the French and Vietnam while the latter was part of French Indochina (approx. late-1800s), the rise and fall of Diem after a disorganized rule, and proceeds with America's involvement with Vietnam that got more complicated with the assassination of JFK. The book also takes a narrative approach by plainly describing the events that took place, and there is a section later on in the book that I liked which talked about some of the weaponry that America used against North Vietnam, such as napalm (one example being Agent Orange, which was notorious for severely damaging the skin of those who came around its proximity) and cluster bombs (which ripped off the heads and limbs of those who were around the same area as a detonated cluster bomb). Upon completing the book, the author has a section dedicated to his notes on the sources he consulted to construct this work, which consisted of interviews, historical texts, magazine articles, and other published sources. 

Even though *Vietnam: A History* aims to be a comprehensive and objective source of American and Vietnamese history, I feel that there are many other sources out there pertaining to Vietnam that are more focused and direct rather than all over the place as this one is. I had no issues with the writing quality, and I do understand that effective history is supposed to be written with as much detail as possible, but I'm not so certain why the historian didn't give a vivid picture of the events taking place. I was also confused by why the Watergate scandal was mentioned during the second-to-last chapter on Nixon's handling of the war (though it made sense for the historian to include it because it either served as a link or contributed to Nixon's downfall). I do understand that it was one of those works that helped bring America's concern with the Vietnam War to the forefront, but I wouldn't go ahead and call it ""The First Complete Account on the Vietnam War"" because it just seems like any other history rather than something that sparked a revolution in the history field (however, I may be wrong because the book serves as a companion piece to a PBS TV miniseries that talked about Vietnam, so if you decide to watch it, this book might make more sense to you). 

While I found the book to be a rather decent read, I think that more details could have been used to paint a more vivid picture of Vietnam. ",history,1457224639,WhitePhantom77,14,32,True,2016-03-05
54,How Do I Study Early American Primary Sources?,"Hello, I recently purchased  *James Madison: Writings* and *Thomas Jefferson: Writings* (Library of America versions) from my local used bookstore for pennies on the dollar, but have no idea how to begin to read either of them. How does a layman study the documents presented in these sorts of compilations?

The *Amazon.com* description for *James Madison: Writings*

&gt;The most comprehensive one-volume selection ever published. Arranged chronologically, it contains almost 200 documents written between 1772 and 1836. Included are all 29 of Madison's contributions to The Federalist, as well as speeches and letters that illuminate his central role in framing and ratifying the Constitution and in the adoption of the Bill of Rights; early writings on religious freedom; revealing correspondence with Jefferson, Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and James Monroe; his eloquent denunciations of the Alien and Sedition Acts; influential writings on republican government and constitutional interpretation; and candid private appraisals of the personalities and events he witnessed in four decades of public life. Writings from Madison's terms as secretary of state and president record his determination to uphold American independence during the conflicts of the Napoleonic era and his conscientious leadership of the nation during the fiercely controversial War of 1812. Letters and essays from his retirement reveal his deepening concern over the sectional threat to the federal union he loved. 

The *Amazon.com* description for *Thomas Jefferson: Writings

&gt;The most comprehensive one-volume selection of Jefferson ever published. Contains the ""Autobiography,"" ""Notes on the State of Virginia,"" public and private papers, including the original and revised drafts of the Declaration of Independence, addresses, and 287 letters.

1,Fate of Empires,"[The Fate of Empires](http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/glubb.pdf)

An essay by [John Bagot Glubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bagot_Glubb). A man who lived the fall of the British Empire.

&gt; As numerous points of interest have arisen in the course of this essay, I close with a brief summary, to refresh the reader’s mind. 

* We do not learn from history because our studies are brief and prejudiced. 

* In a surprising manner, 250 years emerges as the average length of national greatness. 

* This average has not varied for 3,000 years. Does it represent ten generations? 

* The stages of the rise and fall of great nations seem to be: 

  * The Age of Pioneers (outburst)  

  * The Age of Conquests 

  * The Age of Commerce 

  * The Age of Affluence 

  * The Age of Intellect 

  * The Age of Decadence. 

* Decadence is marked by:  

  * Defensiveness 

  * Pessimism 

  * Materialism 

  * Frivolity 

  * An influx of foreigners

  * The Welfare State

  * A weakening of religion.

* Decadence is due to: 

  * Too long a period of wealth and power 

  * Selfishness 

  * Love of money 

  * The loss of a sense of duty. 

* The life histories of great states are amazingly similar, and are due to internal factors. 

* Their falls are diverse, because they are largely the result of external causes. 

* History should be taught as the history of the human race, though of course with emphasis on the history of the student’s own country.",history,1456551110,lurkerz0732,19,67,True,2016-02-27

7,An argument against horse archers,"Carrhae made them overrated.

That's it, that is basically the argument.

Explanation;

Through my interest in medieval warfare I naturally went from West to East and ended up with the Mongols.

I picked up books and going through all of them I noticed a pattern, sort of a focus on the horse archers and the composite bow.

After those books I went on a long and grueling march through contemporary sources and found that (large scale)steppe warfare was simply not what most people think it is.

I firmly believe that the battle of Carrhae is embedded into peoples minds to such a degree that it severely influences peoples view and notion of eastern warfare even though it was a completely isolated and weird battle whose description is very different from nearly every other ""horse archer"" battle prior or afterwards.

My personal conclusion;

The Mongols and other steppe horse hordes were actually superb horsemen who used horse archery merely to form battlefield conditions that favor their lancers after which they would embark on massive cavalry charges and massive melee engagements instead of a long arrow barrage that is the usual stereotype.

Basically **every contemporary battle description** they are present in describes such an occurrence, there is no Carrhae, there is no long arrow barrage, there are mentions of sporadic harassment after which there is always a massive cavalry charge.

The most clear case is the greatest Mongol victory over an European faction, the battle of Mohi.

Namely, the Mongols were on the other side of the river Sajo and, after having difficulties with the Hungarian crossbowmen, they decided to march over a bridge and river crossings with relatively serious(by some historians underrated) casualties to take the field and win a spectacular victory.

The issue?

This is the river Sajo;

http://i.imgur.com/TxOjhLf.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/mdntBW8.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/iUq4QOx.jpg

Why were the Mongols, their elite troops under their most elite commanders(Subotai, Batu), forced to march over the river instead of forcing the Hungarians to do so instead if the firepower of their horse archers is as mighty as is constantly repeated by everyone?

Why did they not simply shoot their bows across such a relatively narrow river?

I believe that the answer is simple;

Horse archers are extremely cool and because of that their prowess on the battlefield has been exaggerated, as was the power of their bows.

In reality(read, in my personal opinion), the military might of the eastern cavalry hordes lied in their numerical supremacy (of melee)cavalry, they simply wielded far more horsemen than anyone else and that allowed them to basically choose when to fight and how to fight, which nearly always ensured victory.",history,1456561249,Neutral_Fellow,47,31,True,2016-02-27

22,Reasons for the War of 1812,"Been reading up on the war of 1812. I think its remarkable that most people saw this war due to the British Impressment of American Sailors.

It seems to me that the War had been declared by the USA mostly due to the following reasons.

1. Economic blockage on the USA during the Napoleonic Wars.

2. Following the Treaty of Paris in 1783 the USA and UK continued to quarrel over British Forts in the Northwest and British Military support to the Native Americans. 

3. Prior to 1812 the USA had nearly just as many casualties in St.Clairs defeat (over 700 total casualties dead), Fallen Timbers and the Battles around Indiana and Ohio and Western PA with Native Americans.  This was defined as the Northwest Indian Wars which Americans were ill prepared for.

4. The UK and Canadians had their own designs on the US border with America seeking to carve out an Indian Nation to blunt American expansion West.

5. With the Louisiana Purchase Spain and the UK offered to support to Indian Tribes in the South and South West in an effort to stop American Expansion up the Mississippi River into Missouri. 

To me it seems like America needed the War to gain complete international Sovereignty and respect from the UK and to a lesser degree Spain who held colonies in Florida, Cuba and Mexico (which would be the conflicts that defined the next centuries war with Spain in the Spanish American War).

Impressment ... meeehhhh  shouldn't even be mentioned as a reason for this war. ",history,1455977989,ngenda79,10,12,True,2016-02-20

35,"The kingdom of heaven review on ""History Buffs"" channel.","After reading the History Buffs post, I went and looked at the [Kingdom of Heaven video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTjUu1Bt29o) as it is one of my favorite movies. First, the professionalism and editing on the video is absolutely amazing!! I will be looking at a lot of the other videos.

I think though that the video is overly critical, picking at every little thing. In particular, I disliked the criticism of Balian's arc, and the state of affairs in the Christian and Islamic worlds.


1. Balian's Arc: At the very beginning when Balian the blacksmith is asked of his military background, he answers something to the effect that he has fought ""on horse and as an engineer"". With this much of the criticism of how he got to be so competent completely falls apart. He would have atleast a basic knowledge of siege engines, procuring water for large armies, battle strategies, and horseback fighting.
With respect to everyone liking and trusting Balian from the word go, you have the  priest travelling with Godfrey reaching Jerusalem first and letting everyone in on how Balian appears to be a guy with a good heart. 
On the point of how he got to be the Baron of Ibelin, The king confirms Godfrey's appointment like he is supposed to. 
On why they want him to replace Guy as king, well he is the only option since Isabella isn't sleeping with anyone else. And he appears to be trustworthy.


2. Christian and Islamic Differences: I am glad that Nick made the point of mentioning that Crusades were somewhat justified. I had never thought of it that way and it makes a lot of sense. However, the criticism of dull west were vibrant east are overly harsh. For one a large city like Jerusalem would be definitely more vibrant than a feudal village in winter France, but that can be argued. The movie is geared towards western viewers and needs to establish that Western Europe was somewhat stale and that the Arab world was on the rise. On Christian bad versus Muslim good comparisons... while the movie definitely does cater to this narrative, Nick ignores that most of the christian vitriol comes from the Templars and that except for Saladin and his close advisers other Muslims have shown to be violent  (oversimplification in the movies but not nearly as bad as Nick suggests).


TLDR: Movie has its issues but review is much too Harsh. Ignores Balian's horseback fighting and military engineering experience in Europe. Exaggerates movie flaws comparing Jerusalem to Western Europe.

52,My Story of Survival in The Khmer Rouge's Genocide of the Cambodian People,"The topic of Cambodian history in the 1970’s is not as popular as it once was. Either people haven’t heard about it or some simply don’t care, and what took place under the Khmer Rouge regime has begun to fade out of people’s memory. After the making of “The Killing Fields” in 1985 the topic of the Cambodian Genocide was at the forefront of people’s thoughts, but has since subsided. Now with the production of new movie of the killing fields based on the book First They Killed My Father is making people think twice about what happened in Cambodia. The movie is scheduled to be ready for release sometime next year, and it brings to mind the struggles I also faced during that time.

While the movie is still in the making, you can check out my similar survival story My Life According To My Destiny. My story is full of both details of my survival and the historical subject matter. It relates my families struggle under the Khmer Rouge regime while still keeping it full of Cambodia’s rich history so the reader has a fuller understanding of the tragedy that took place. Currently rated Five Stars on Amazon, My Life According To My Destiny is available in paperback, kindle, and audiobook.

4,"My thoughts on ""The Holocaust"" by Martin Gilbert.","A week ago, I decided to explore some more information about the Holocaust, so I went to a public library and found *The Holocaust: A History of the Jews of Europe During the Second World War*. I spent a few days zooming through it and I felt that those few days spent on the book were highly rewarding. 

Sure, there are many histories that deal with the Holocaust as there are for many of World War II's battles and significant moments, but I feel that Martin Gilbert's work is quite possibly as close as the student can get to a ""comprehensive"" or ""definitive"" history or this tragic series of events. 

First off, unlike other histories which try to focus on everything centering the event, this book succeeds at keeping the POV centered around the Jewish, with many passages depicted as oral histories. The purpose of the oral histories is to highlight certain voices that had the courage to describe some of the most inhumane moments that took place between the SS and the Jews. These histories range from depicting mass shootings to savagely harming children and young infants (there is one passage in the book which depicts an SS officer stabbing a baby with a bayonet, as well as another which depicts another officer grabbing a baby by the feet and smashing its entire body and torso towards a wall, which let out a heavy gash of blood and gore). There's also the mention of historical figures such as Albert Einstein, who was expelled from his home for his Jewish lineage, and Sigmund Freud, whose sisters were gassed in concentration camps. For the majority of the book, Gilbert describes with vivid clarity the many random acts of violence that the SS commits towards the Jewish in Germany's many concentration camps, with Auschwitz and Birkenau being some of the most infamous, such as gassing the weak, physically ill, and young on arrival, the poisoning of much of the sick, elderly, and mentally ill during ""experiments"" conducted by depraved German scientists and doctors, and a massive collage of assaults, beatings, the demoralization of the Jews, and the amount of shooting sprees that SS officers engage in for the sole purpose of getting rid of many Jews (most of the time, in the hundreds or the thousands). 

I found Gilbert's analysis of the Holocaust engaging because he writes in a style that is both clear and dense. The images that the historian conveys evokes a sense of vividness in conjunction with a heavy amount of detail supporting his arguments and claims. During the book, he manages to make some helpful hypotheses of those who have perished in the Holocaust while also presenting with the reader of a few important photos that give a vague portrait at first before being carefully examined. In this case, it is up to the reader to examine the images and determine the mood in which the book tries to invoke, which is a feeling of sadness, hopelessness, courage, and the many degrees of evil.

After finishing this book just now, I started seeing the Holocaust as a grim struggle between the utmost good and fragile and the most depraved and horrific aspects of humanity and what it's capable of. I found it a fast read at some points, but at the same time, it was also a book that I had to pay close attention to if I wanted to better absorb as much as I could. 

The front cover of the paperback version has a quote from Elie Wiesel, who considered it ""a fascinating book that overwhelms us with the truth"", and he was right. *The Holocaust* is a work of history that has the ability to both mesmerize and terrify.

Also something that does bug me a little about this is the supremacist attitudes of both sides who naturally assume north Africa to be either white or black but if remember correctly North Africans are just a Mediterranean people who've been there for thousands upon thousands of years and mixed with a ton of different people and are more accurately put in the category of ""not black/white"" but that other group of people that a massive chunk of humanity falls under (obnoxious sarcasm).

I've decided to take the next couple of weeks to study it.

What would be your recommended learning path for somebody who's actually clueless? I prefer a structured path, where I can focus on learning about one aspect at a time. Also, I live by the 80/20 rule- so I only prefer learning about major events and concepts, and avoiding unnecessary topics if I can. 

e.g.

-World War I

-World War II

-The Holocaust

-Cold War

The commanders of the operation was the infamous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria and the orders were given by the Beria and approved by Josef Stalin. The reason of the deportation was announced as the treason and mass collaboration with the fascists although there were thousand of Chechens and Ingushes died fighting with the fascists no the front-line, and many of them had became the war heroes, including the very famous ones like Abdulkhakim Ismailov who is one of the men that raised the Soviet flag over the Reichstag or Khanpasha Nuradilov, who had been credited with over 920 confirmed kills when he died at Stalingrad, and officially there were tens of thousand of Chechens and Ingushes fighting at the ranks of the Red Army, and Nazis were never had managed to reach to the Chechnya, and the except the ones that fought the Nazis, the whole population had never seen a Nazi at their entire lives.

The entire population had been deported, and excluding a few that managed to escape to the mountains for seeking revenge, and the men, women and children (who were consisting nearly a half of the deported population) had rounded up and put into the cattle cars just in a few days and they were deported to the various locations from their homeland, which took some weeks while they were only allowed to take three days of worth food. Thousands had died everyday during the deportation and their bodies were simply tossed out of the cars, while the reason of the death were not just due to the harsh conditions, like the massacre of the entire population of the aul Khaibakh, 700 people including the elderly, women and children, by burning them alive because it was impossible to convoy them to the cars due to the snowstorm, and any resistance to the deportation had met by slaughters.

Soviet numbers conclude a figure that one third of the entire Vainakh population had been perished during the exile, while other researches do come up with numbers that is equivalent of the 50-60% of the entire population.

Not just people had been killed but also Chechen-Ingush Republic was removed from the maps, the population hadn't been allowed to return their homes and their homeland until it was allowed after Nikita Khrushchev became the First Secretary, the parts of the Chechen-Ingush homeland was granted to the other republics, including the Prigorodny District which was gifted to the North Ossetia which again caused problems aftermath, the cleansed country had been settled by others, the names had been changed, Chechen and Ingush books and texts were burned, families were divided and not allowed to see each other or travel to the places that they are, some Chechen or Ingush settlements were even got deleted from the books, and even graveyards had been destroyed and the gravestones had been used to pave roads or as materials to build houses by some of the new-coming settlers.

The deportation is recognized as an act of genocide, within the meaning of the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 an the Convention for the Prevention and Repression of the Crime of Genocide adopted by the UN General Assembly on 9 December 1948, by the European Parlaiment in February 2004.

The reason for this question is because I'm having a debate of sorts with an acquaintance about this, and though I was *pretty* sure that he was totally wrong, I don't know enough about this period to be 100%, so I figured this was the best place to ask.

He stated this theory to me, which I've heard before, both here on Reddit and on other sites, that though of course Hitler didn't like jews, and obviously ordered them to be removed from the general population, the theory states that Hitler's only direct involvement was in getting them identified with the star, then rounded up, placed in ghettos and then sent to concentration camps. It goes on to state that the mass-murders at the concentration camps was down to the commanders at the particular camps, and that Hitler didn't actually directly order or suggest that the jews be murdered on the scale that they were. It goes on to imply that Hitler was either completely unaware of the mass-murder, or simply apathetic to it, but that he didn't actually order it, and the decision to murder the 6,000,000 Jews was actually down to his subordinate officers who were the commanders of the camps. Is there any evidence at all that this could actually be the case? Is this a plausible theory in the eyes of historians &amp; Holocaust scholars, or is it just some more nonsense churned out by the Neo-Nazi, racist Holocaust-deniers/Nazi apologists? 

Thanks for reading, would appreciate your input. And again, please don't mistake me for being anti-semitic or anything of that nature.

71,A History of Navigation and Cartography during age of Discovery,"I have posted this previously on the reddit, but apparently the history subreddit rules forbid a link to other areas of reddit. 

I sail some and I'm fascinated by history, especially the Age of Sail and Exploration.  I summarized below some of what I've found about the history of navigation and cartography, quite a bit is from Wikipedia and some other online sources. I'm trying to trace the introduction of various technologies and the improvements in accuracy. I'm using a timeline format to better show the cause and effect, the same style James Burke used in Connections.

Two of my main sources that I started with are:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_longitude

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_navigation

~200BC Eratosthenes of Cyrene , chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria, estimates the circumference of earth to be 25000 mi using shadows (cast in wells or by architecural columns). He is off by less than .2%. (there is some debate about the accuracy due to confusing issues with ancient units).

~150AD Claudius Ptolemy wrote and researched astronomy, mathematic, geography. He adopts 18000 mi as circumference of earth. His maps and books are last main source of information for Middles ages Europe although Eratosthenes not entirely forgotten.

1200s first clocks invented in monastaries to regulate prayer. Arabic and Chinese designs do predate but connections with European clocks are hazy. These clocks are not very accurate and only have an hour hand.

1300s Compass is introduced to Europe from China via the Middle East.

1430s Henry the Navigator, Portugal, kicks off the Age of Discovery by funding voyages to discover routes to the far East around Africa. Critical to the ways east, was a way back. The discovery of the North Atlantic Gyre made this possible. European sailors used this phenomenon for centuries to come.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volta_do_mar

1492 Columbus sails west to find the far east. He underestimates the distance to Asia because he uses Ptolemy's estimate of the Earths circumference. Juan de la Cosa is the master and owner of the Santa Maria on the first voyage and accompanies Columbus on subsequent voyages. He is also cartographer for Columbus. His only surviving map is from 1500. Cuba is on the left in the center depicted as an island despite Columbus claiming its part of the Asian mainland. The map is on parchment. Its hard to tell how widely circulated it or copies were at the time. Cosa was killed a few years later in present day Columbia by natives, his widow was awarded captured natives as slaves for back payments.

1525 Ferdinand Magellan's, Portuguese but sailing for the Spanish, expedition circumnavigates the earth and returns to Spain with 18crew after starting with 270. Magellan was killed in the Philippines. The voyage took 36months and covered 37,500miles. Despite faithfullly keeping a log book the whole time, they lost one day because they travelled west, opposite the Earths daily rotation(their days were 1.31minutes longer on average as a result). This caused great excitement at the time, and a special delegation was sent to the Pope to explain the oddity to him. Despite the loss of ships enough spices were brought back to make a small profit. However, the returning crew were still not paid full wages. 

1533 Dutchman Gemma Frisius invents system of triangulation for surveying on land. He also creates improved versions of the cross-staff, astrolabe and Astronomical rings. His student is Gerardus Mercator. Frisius proposes that accurate time difference between two points can be used to determine longitude. 

FYI, At the Equator, 1 hour of time = 15 degree of earth rotation. or 1 second of time = .00417degree = 15 angular seconds = .29miles or .25nautical miles.

1562 Spanish Diego Gutiérrez publishes map of western hemisphere. Latitude was probably determined by astrolabe with error of approxomitly 15nautical miles under good conditions. Longitude was determined by dead reckoning by estimating speed over distance, often by letting out a knotted string and timing with a 28-second sand glass. The method is surprisingly good over a few days, but over a few weeks error accumulates and can be hundreds of miles, especially in rough weather. Engraving for this map was done in Amsterdam, Spain did not have the ability to publish such a large, detailed map. Amsterdam was under Spanish rule until the start of the 80 Years war and creation of the Dutch Republic in 1581.

1569 Gerardus Mercator invents the Mercator Projection mapping system, new projection for a nautical chart which had vertical lines of longitude, spaced evenly, so that sailing courses of constant bearing were represented as straight lines (loxodromes).

1610-1613 Galileo uses the newly invented telescope to discover and chart the moons of Jupiter. Their oribits and eclipses with Jupiter work as a clock observable from earth to provide a consistent time. The moon Io has an orbit of 42 hours and is particularily useful. But Galileo was never able to construct accurate tables. Both the Dutch and Spanish chose not to fund the studies because viewing the moons from the deck of a ship via a telescope was not practical. Also, there are few months of the year when Jupiter is too close to the Sun(as viewed from earth) for the moons to be observed. However, I am confused why it wasn't considered a viable alternative for land based longitude calculation.

1614 John Napier, Scottish, publishes 'Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio' inventing the use of logarithms which made astronomical calculations much easier.

1615 Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snellius (a.k.a. Snell) introduced the modern systematic use of triangulation(for surveying between local landmarks, not establishing global positioning). He surveyed the distance from Alkmaar to Bergen op Zoom, approximately 70 miles (110 kilometres) using a series of triangles. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation

1620-1650 William Oughtred, English, invents and improves the slide rule for scientific and engineering calculations. its remains popular until the early 1970s.

1631, Pierre Vernier, French, invents quadrant that was accurate to one minute of arc. In theory, this level of accuracy could give a line of position within a nautical mile of the navigator's actual position (latitude). It is based on Pedro Nunes's, Portuguese, 1542 Nonius, an updated astrolabe. 

1640 Hondius, Picart, Boisseau, Dutch and French. Published new map of West Hemisphere. Improved East Coast of the US, central America and north part of South America. West Coast of North America is newly mapped but skewed. I'm not sure what the improvements are the result of. It could be better dead reckoning or some use of Jupiter moons, although they would need a clock to keep accurate time between an eclipse event(universal time) and a star transit(local time), a period possibly several hours(my guess). This map is from the leading map making company in Amsterdam. This is the last good map I can find before Cassini's tables of Jupiters moons are created.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_navigation#/media/File:America_noviter_delineata.jpg

1656 Christiaan Huygens, Dutch, makes the first pendulum clock based directly on work by Galileo. Accuracy of clocks is improved from 15minutes per day to 15seconds per day. Minute and second hands begin to be put on clocks.

1668 Giovanni Domenico Cassini. Louis XIV funds the startup for the Academie Royale des Sciences Paris Observatory and names Cassini its director. Cassini published the first truly accurate table of Galilean eclipses. Several previous attempts were not accurate enough.

1670s Cassini uses the Jupiter Moons to resurvey France from land locations. Signicant changes reduce the size of France. Upon seeing this map, King Louis XIV remarked that he was losing more territory to his astronomers than to his enemies (everyone laughs once they are sure its a joke). 

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/France_cotes_academie.png

1675 Charles II funds the creation of Greenwich Observatory. Christopher Wren selects the site and the original building.

1676 Important side note. Danish astronomer Olaeus Rømer was able, in 1676, to find a systematic error of in the eclipses of Jupiters Moons corresponding to Jupiters position relative to the sun. He attibuted it the suns gravity effect on light and computed the speed of light within 30%. The discovery is not widely accepted.

1707 October 22, Scilly naval disaster was the loss of four warships of a Royal Navy fleet off the Isles of Scilly (Archipelago off Cornwall, England) in severe weather. 1,550 sailors aboard the wrecked vessels lost their lives, making the incident one of the worst maritime disasters in the history of the British Isles. The rocks that were hit were at a known location, the ships were in a storm throwing off their 'dead reckoning', causing the disaster. (is that where the name dead reckoning comes from? its inaccurate enought to make you dead..)

Its the last great map I can find of the west hemisphere prior to the improved longitude tools. I've been looking for sources on whether Jupiter moons are used for plotting landmarks in the western hemisphere, but I can't find any. But this map is too good not to have been made that way.

1730, John Hadley invented the first sextant. The sextant is improved by several designers over the next 30 years. Its very accurate for measuring off the horizon for latitude and replaces several previous devices. Its also capable of measuring between objects.

1755, Tobias Mayer, German, proposes method using Lunar Distance for computing longitude at sea, by measuring the angle of the moon and (typically) the star Regulus using a sextant. The calculations are intense without precalucated tables(later).

1761 John Harrison had managed to make clocks so accurate and impervious to motion that they could be carried on a ship and not err by more than seconds(some tests lost over 30seconds) on a trip to from Britainto the East Indies. Using sea watch time relative to the local time at noon or other star transits (star passing directly overhead), longitude could be measure between 1-10 nautical mile. However, there is controvery over the practicality due to the expense of the watch.

1767 Nevil Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal (Director of Greenwich, also he's the bad guy in book and movie by Dava Sobel), publishes Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeri. It included daily tables of the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets and other astronomical data, as well as tables of lunar distances giving the distance of the Moon from the Sun and nine stars suitable for lunar observations (ten stars for the first few years). At best lunar distance is accurate to one-quarter of a degree of Longitude or 15 nautical miles. The sextant became the instrument of choice for the lunar distance method.

1767 to about 1850. Lunar distances were widely used at sea because a sextant was cheaper than the early sea watches. It continued to be used on land through 1906 when harsh conditions made time pieces unreliable. For the determination of longitude on land, the preferred method became exchanges of chronometers(scientific watches) between observatories to accurately determine the differences in local times in conjunction with observation of the transit of stars across the meridian. Throughout the period Harrisons clocks and successor were used to synchronize clocks around the world and determine more precise longitude of remote locations.

1784 a team from General William Roy's Ordnance Survey of Great Britain began the Principal Triangulation of Britain (nation wide survey of numerous landmark points). The first Ramsden theodolite was built for this survey. It was completed in 1853. The Ramsden theodolite could measure angles to within one arc second

1884 International Meridian Conference met to settle on a Prime Meridian for the world. Greenwich is selected.

1902-1909 Einstein worked for the Swiss patent office. Enstein reviewed many patent proposals for synchronzing clocks around the world using telegraph and other schemes.

1923 September 8, Honda Point disaster. The US Navy has its biggest shipwreck accident. During rough seas the fleet was using dead reckoning techniques for portions of the trip. Radio direction finding was available to give continous navigation readings, but it was new and untrusted.

35,*reposted from genealogy subreddit* question on accuracy/legitimacy.,"I'm sure this is a common question, at least I feel it must be. Anyway, here goes, I began researching my family about 4 years ago now, when I discovered a treasure trove of previously forgotten/unknown family history. Within , I found my great, great aunt's geneoloical research she began collecting sometime around the early 20th c.

 I decided to run with it, I began to fact check her research as best I could with books available online, census, general research materials etc. Her research hit a dead end at about the 1400s or so, however from what I've been able to gather it's all about 95% accurate. The family had a long storied colonial american history to a degree, and then an incredible amount of notable lines throughout Wales, England, Ireland, Scotland, France, etc. Not to mention loads of cousins marrying right up until the 1800s. 

I'm curious how common this is, especially to be connected through to so many vastly interesting figures of history. I know were all related to Charlemagne and all that, but how common is it to have multiple lines run through and connect, and almost seem to have pre ordained marriages to keep the line going right up to the 1800s. 

It just seems bizarre, and hard to believe. My grandmothers side of the family always had a chip on their shoulder, and were always well to do, and influential until the line seemingly went extinct in the 1990s, but I just can't seem to believe it to be true that the stories they said of being descended from Welsh kings, and French royalty are indeed true.

*HENRY IV. of France, when hunting one day, happened to be separated from his attendants, and, in endeavouring to find them, he saw a peasant on a rising ground. The King asked him what he was doing there? He answered, that he stood there to get a sigh of the King, and was very solicitous to know if he would pass that way. Upon which his Majesty bade him get up behind him, and he would bring him to the place where the King was. Accordingly he mounted, and as they rode along, amongst other questions that passed in conversation, the peasant asked how he should distinguish the King from the nobility that attended him? Very easily, says Henry, for all the rest will have their hats off. It was not long before they fell in with the company, who all uncovered immediately; upon which his Majesty, leering over his shoulder, asked the peasant, if he could guess which was the King? By my faith, replied he, it must be either you or me, for all the rest have their hats off.*

- beer

- hard cider

- mead

- punch

- sack(?)

- distilled liqueurs

- flip

The author tried to replicate this old drink called flip, and she either got it wrong, or it is the most terrible concoction ever invented. Part of the recipe is to plunge a hot loggerhead from the fire into the drink.

31,Weekly Who's Who of History: Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte,"Hello everyone. I've mostly been a lurker here and I post very rarely. I'd like to make a contribution which would be a weekly feature highlighting personalities from history which many nowadays would not know about, but these personnages have quite a story to tell.

I did a quick search here in r/history to ensure the people I'd write about weren't already focal points of any topics in the past.

--------

First up is **Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte**, a man whom I've read about extensively in the past whose story I'd like to share.

-----------

Bernadotte was a French general under Napoleon, eventually conferred with the rank of Marshal of France. He married Napoleon's ex-fiancé and had been part of many battles under Bonaparte.

Now, this life and career might seem quite *ho-hum*, with the likes of luminaries such as Ney or Davout, but, a sudden change in fortunes would turn Bernadotte into more than just a Corsican's subordinate.

---------

After a battle wherein many Swedish prisoners had been captured, Bernadotte showed charity and mercy to these men. This undoubtedly put him in a favorable light in the eyes of some Swedes.

At a time when the Swedish king was old, frail and heirless, Swedish politicians wondered about the future of the monarchy. Impressed with Napoleon's successes, some felt they needed a ruler who had French military experience and discipline.

Enter Baron Mörner, a minor noble who, upon hearing of Bernadotte's good treatment of Swedes and administrative skill, suggested he become heir-apparent to the Swedish throne.

Thus, Bernadotte was adopted by the old king as a son.

Napoleon was indifferent to the entire affair, and perhaps even felt Bernadotte would follow his lead. Bernadotte had other plans however, becoming ""Swedish"". He changed his name to Charles John and renounced Catholicism. He even went into battle as part of a Coalition against France.

Bernadotte would gain the crown of Sweden as well as Norway. He would establish the ""House of Bernadotte"" - which, consequently, still rules Sweden to this very day.

----------

**TL;DR:**

A random French general under Napoleon was approached by a random noble from Sweden for him to become king. He accepted, and this random event led to his descendants still ruling Sweden to this very day.

Well done, Bernadotte.

I hope you guys enjoyed the story.

Men, women, half men-half women, no one wanted to classify them as either or.

Can't remember exactly what the text was about or what it described, but the argument she was making was that the ideas of gender, and especially just two contrasting ones, were a social invention, and a rather modern one as well.

I doubted her source and her claim then, and now, after studying history for half a year, I haven't read anything to support it.

Is there anything true about this view on gender in the ancient world? Some city states in Greece with some unusual norms perhaps?

39,A question on a Japanese/Korean culture disputes. *Warning could be a bit intense*,"A Korean lady I know said some utterly insane sounding things to me lately about Japanese culture. It came out when she found out I practised karate (which she claims is stolen from Korea by the Japanese, ignoring the Okinawan aspect of the history all-together). Now, I dont believe her wording of the subject, but I'd like to ask, knowing very little about Korea in general.

Did Korea have much influence on Japanese culture, such as music, clothing etc without that coming from China or Okinawa first? Main reason I ask is because, while my knowledge is limited in asia to martial arts and mythology mostly, I didnt believe a word that was said to me when it was presented like it is below (which is how she put it to me):

1- Japanese language originated from Korean, they just were too stupid to use the language properly
2- Koreans gave clothing to japanese people, who were naked beforehand
3- Korea tried to teach the japanese how to use cutlery, but refused to give them forks and spoons till they could use chopsticks properly, which never happened
4 - Japan doctors its history, unlike Korea, Korea has history exactly as is and always has been
5 - Japan has a long and well documented history of cannibalizing Koreans, right up until the end of the occupation (this last one sounded utterly unbelievable!)

Now the above sounded hateful/racist to me, making japan out to sound utterly savage and primitive,  but is this sort of talk fuelled on the history between the countries or is there anything to suggest Korea influenced any of the things she mentioned?

King Kamehameha of Hawaii was also believed to be at least 7ft and King King Mutara-III of Rwanda was somewhere between 6'8""-7'.

26,Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara. Applying McNamara's Lessons to,"Hey R/History! Just finished watching McNamara's 'Fog of War' and I must say this is the most emotional and impactful documentary I have ever watched. McNamara does an exceptional job of portraying his story and I think he becomes progressively more 'human' throughout the documentary. I actually watched it twice in the last 24 hours. It made me wonder how you could apply McNamara's lessons to either the war in Afghanistan or Iraq at the time. Here are his 11 Lessons for those who do not know them or don't feel like scouring the internet for them (taken from wikipedia).

1. We misjudged then — and we have since — the geopolitical intentions of our adversaries … and we exaggerated the dangers to the United States of their actions.
2. We viewed the people and leaders of South Vietnam in terms of our own experience … We totally misjudged the political forces within the country.
3. We underestimated the power of nationalism to motivate a people to fight and die for their beliefs and values.
4. Our misjudgments of friend and foe, alike, reflected our profound ignorance of the history, culture, and politics of the people in the area, and the personalities and habits of their leaders.
5. We failed then — and have since — to recognize the limitations of modern, high-technology military equipment, forces, and doctrine. We failed, as well, to adapt our military tactics to the task of winning the hearts and minds of people from a totally different culture.
6. We failed to draw Congress and the American people into a full and frank discussion and debate of the pros and cons of a large-scale military involvement … before we initiated the action.
7. After the action got under way, and unanticipated events forced us off our planned course … we did not fully explain what was happening, and why we were doing what we did.
8. We did not recognize that neither our people nor our leaders are omniscient. Our judgment of what is in another people's or country's best interest should be put to the test of open discussion in international forums. We do not have the God-given right to shape every nation in our image or as we choose.
9. We did not hold to the principle that U.S. military action … should be carried out only in conjunction with multinational forces supported fully (and not merely cosmetically) by the international community.
10. We failed to recognize that in international affairs, as in other aspects of life, there may be problems for which there are no immediate solutions … At times, we may have to live with an imperfect, untidy world.
11. Underlying many of these errors lay our failure to organize the top echelons of the executive branch to deal effectively with the extraordinarily complex range of political and military issues.

Let me know what you guys think and how you could apply any of these lessons to the war.

50,War Time Diaries,"Last year I had the opportunity to work on a World War II wartime diary for one of my college classes. Vernon Goetz rose to the rank of 1st Sergeant during his tour in Europe. He was a member of the 549th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapon Battalion. Throughout his stay in Europe, Goetz wrote about the things he did/witnessed in his wartime diary. In my research of this diary, I tracked down a second member of his battalion, Mr. Arenstein, a 1st lieutenant in the 549th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapon Battalion. Similarly to Goetz, Arenstein wrote in a diary about the events that he went through. While soldiers keeping diaries during war is not totally unusual, the similarity of the entries is what I'm having a problem understanding. 

On Dec 22, 1944 Goetz wrote: Another quiet day. Transferred from 3RD to 7th army as of 1000. 3rd army now up fighting German Counter attack. Tomorrow 1st Platoon moves F.A. 2 and 4 to Oermingen and 1 and 3 to Gros Rederching. 

On the same day Arenstein wrote: Another quiet day. Transferred from 3RD to 7th army as of 1000. Third army now up fighting German Counter-attack. Tomorrow Lavin moves F.U. 2 and 4 to Oermingen and 1 and 3 to Gros Rederching. 

With this diary entry being mostly troop movement it is not surprising that their diaries are similar, but this continues to happen throughout the diaries, and sometimes on a more personal level

5th of January Goetz writes: Same old story. Information not as plentiful as in the past. We seem to have the bastards cornered but things are moving very slowly. Stiffer resistance but still no enemy aircraft. When we arrive they seem to leave, maybe we're a good luck Bn. The constant shelling gets on your nerves and yet the periods of silence worry you even more because you wonder why they aren't shelling. You just can't win.  

On the same day Arenstein wrote: Same old story. Information not as plentiful as in the past. We seem to have the bastards cornered but thins are moving very slowly. Stiffer resistance but still no enemy aircraft. When we arrive they seem to leave, maybe we're a good looking Bn. The constant shelling gets on your nerves and yet the periods of silence worry you even more because you wonder why they aren't shelling. You can't win.  

My thoughts are either that Arenstein had Goetz write his journal entries for him due to the fact that Arenstein would have been preoccupied with the duties of being second-in-charge, but the only problem with this theory is there are some entries that are spot on besides a personal comment about a member of Arenstein's family in the middle.

Another theory might be that they wrote in their diaries together (I don't know which officers slept together), but in several entries it makes it clear that the two officers were not necessarily fond of each other.

Does anyone know why this could be? I'm also putting up this post in hopes that I could find another member of the 549th in hopes that they too kept a diary so that we would have another to compare it to!",history,1446942225,FlyingGopher16,4,1,True,2015-11-07

Need sources.,"So I was discussing the youtube channel [The Great War](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGreatWar/featured) with my friend and that's when he told me that he thought that World War 1 was the dumbest of wars. When I asked him why, he said  the war consisted of a sting of strong countries backing up their allies by going to war over the death of Franz Ferdinand. When I tried to explain to him that the death of Franz Ferdinand was a Cassus Belli for the central powers and that the war most likely would have happened because both the allies and central powers were already quite militarized before that happened also, I told him that I also believed that Russia was building their military railway way before the war started but he disagreed and said that the war would not have happened if Franz Ferdinand was not assassinated.

ANYWAYS, I need some sources and contributions from you guys. I could be wrong too, so feel free to argue against me. 

ALSO, If the central powers did plan to attack before the assassination of Ferdinand. why? Could it be because they were losing their foothold in Europe as the colonizing powers were growing too powerful?

Basically, in 1995, the USGovt revealed they had in-depth knowledge of soviet intelligence from the middle of WW2 to 1980. The detail was so good that not only did few know about it, but ti was used to implicate spies in the US so well that it could never be revealed in court and often forced prosecutors to limit their knowledge of how such intelligence was gained in order to protect the secret. Famously, as many protested the Rosenbergs trial, it was revealed after VERONA was uncovered that not only were they spies but they were unrepentant in their behavior. 

Reading about all of the people subsequently tagged within the VERONA transmission (some of which are still classified and progressively rolled out over time) it seems that McCarthy really might have known how flooded with communists the US Government really was in the 50s.

He was struck off strength from his aa unit in July 1945, and left India from Chennai in October 1945.


My question is what could he have been doing in those two places in that period of time? Does anyone know what was happening in Bombay and Chennai in the final months of the war?


My best guess is that since he was an experienced AA crewman and because Britain was gearing up for a final showdown against Japan, and because those two cities are industrial centres, he must have had some role in protecting those industries. But they are well beyond the range of Japanese bombers , few of which existed at that point in the war anyway.

89,"Common Causes of Death, 1876, Philadelphia","Somebody in a thread on Ask Historians was asking about the murder rate is eastern cities in the late 19th century, and I mentioned it was really the least of your worries during that time. So I thought I would show a list of causes of death at that time. This data is taken from a table of data in the Philadelphia Inquirer of August 15, 1876, and shows the breakdown for the past week.

Total deaths 404

169 were adults

235 were children

134 were under 1 year old


-  59 Cholera Infantum

- 47 Consumption (tuberculosis)

- 32 Marasmus (malnutrition)

- 23 Convulsions (? could be many causes)

- 23 Typhoid Fever

- 19 Stomach and Bowel Inflammation

- 19 Debility

- 15 Old Age

- 10 Casualties (death by misadventure)

- 10 Dropsy (water accumulation, causing congestive heart failure)

- 10 Inanition (exhaustion, lack of food and water)

- 8 Brain Inflammation

- 8 Lung Inflammation

- 8 Disease of Heart (heart attack)

- 7 Diphtheria

- 5 Diarrhea

- 5 Dysentery

- 5 Softening of Brain (?)

- 4 Small Pox

- 4 Whooping Cough

- 4 Apoplexy

- 4 Cancer

- 4 Croup

- 3 Paralysis

- 3 Bright's Disease

- 2 Cholera Morbus 

- 2 Scarlet Fever

- 2 Murder


The top killer is  Cholera Infantum, and in adults was often called ""summer complaint"". It is caused by a Campylobacter bacteria that is common in the warmer drinking water of summer. It is often lethal to children, and causes severe cramping and bloating in adults, and sometimes death.

Marasmus is a disease of wasting away from malnutrition. In this case, the cause is not stated, but it can be caused by disease or by just lack of food.

The use of chlorinated water supply and vaccinations have grossly reduced most of the items on this list, so the things we worry about today tend to be a few of the smaller items on the list, like heart disease and cancer.

The most popular opinion amongst my colleagues was how Luxemburg was absolutely right, and that people should have risen up and revolted, and that capitalism was evil, and still is evil today.  One girl even went onto steer the conversation to how Luxemburg's work relates to the current Migrant crisis in Europe and how we still retain the ""heartless mentality"" of WWI and how ""idiotic"" the Social Democrats of Germany then were to spur Luxemburg.

As a setting, I want to go with the 10-15 centuries, primarily because that was the Feudal era and it falls in line with the theme of the game (""Feudal"" Wars). You can view some of the artwork for the different civilizations on the subreddit (r/feudalwars). 

I'm not exactly a history buff so I wanted to pick your brains as to what the setting of the game should be like. If you haven't played age of empires (what my game will be like), you essentially start out as a civilization of your choice and you can make buildings, armies with the artwork of the buildings/armies matching the style of the civilization. For example, here is our spanish barracks:
http://i.imgur.com/DuA4eD2.png
And here is our english barracks:
http://i.imgur.com/s5t9AXj.png

One of the problems I'm confronted with is determining which civilizations the game should have. I want to start out with English and Spanish but Spain of course didn't exist from 10-15 and was more divided into kingdoms like Corsica and Leon (right?). I certainly wouldn't mind calling the civ ~~Corsica~~ Castile instead of Spanish and I could use the castilian coat of arms (since that's public domain) but is that historically accurate? 

If you had to list the dominant united military powers from 10-15, what would they be? Again, I'm not looking for exact historical accuracy - I just want to portray a ""rounded off"" version of history. What civilizations would you put in the game and how would you name them? I'm looking for kingdom name and people name (e.g. England / English). I'm also looking to portray civs with distinct architectural styles. For example, 1 of the reasons we chose English and Spanish starting out was because of the distinct architectural styles of the two in the latter middle ages. I'm going to want to have middle eastern and far east civs (Japanese obviously) as well. 

I'd appreciate any advice!",history,1443996153,styxynx,10,12,True,2015-10-04

55,Park Chung-hee: The “Pint-Sized Stalin”?,"Found this sidebar article about South Korea's Park Chung-hee regime of the mid-1970s to be rather interesting:    

*Park Chung-hee: The “Pint-Sized Stalin”?*    
Obvious comparisons can be made between Josef Stalin’s system of rule and that of Park Chung-hee’s Yushin Order. Dig a little deeper, and one will realize that the comparisons to Stalin can really only go so far. The big distinctions should be clear, and one of the most important was that Park never nationalized industry. The Korean president and his advisors were far too enamored with the Japanese model and the postwar “miracle” economy of West Germany; they had learned enough from these examples to know that any effective economic theory made use of the skills of the entrepreneur. In any case, even by Stalin’s time there were no serious economic theorists in the world who thought that a command economy could exist without a major provision for private enterprise.    


The core distinction is that Park’s rule never reached the level of control over business and society that would have made him as widely feared as Stalin, although horrible were Park’s methods and earnest were the attempts. It was Stalin who came closest to proving that a state could plan every detail of an economy only at the cost of terrorizing a large portion of the population who might have hoped to benefit from it. Park’s regime was a bit more restrained than to take things as far as the Soviets had. Even when comparing the Yushin Order to similar right-wing autocratic regimes of the time–for example, Augusto Pinochet’s Chile–an exact analogy falls short. Pinochet “disappeared” 119 dissidents in 1975 alone, and eventually murdered well over 2,000 by the time he was done. Park’s autocracy never approached that level of depravity. Instead, he mostly relied on a system of ordinances, and administrative and surveillance measures to keep a lid on all dissident activity and popular movements, justifying his repression by law wherever possible. The Yushin Order incentivized dissidents to lie still and say nothing. Under Stalin, boisterous praise of the regime would have been the only survivable posture.    


Although he would never allow democratization to interfere with his grand economic plans, the South Korean president attempted to keep up the minimum appearances of a constitutional, representative government. There may be reasons for this; it cannot be forgotten that South Korea received great benefit from its position in the Cold War, not to mention being connected to the world market system, in which it took particular advantage of opportunities open to it in Asia and North America. If Park Chung-hee had really been another Stalin, it is unlikely in the extreme that the government and businesses of Japan, for example, would have continued to provide South Korea with economic assistance, which by the end of 1982 had totaled $4.4 billion USD, as well as to provide the Koreans with the second most important market for the sale of their products.    


And no matter how convincing the arguments, one should be very careful in using comparisons to Stalin to explain away the success of the Park-era economy. Despite the valid descriptions of a ruthless, antidemocratic “success at all costs” business approach, the real achievements of Park’s model came mainly from Korean businesses’ fundamental competitiveness in world markets, due largely to a commitment to an “engineering approach,” as established under the guidance of Park’s technocrats. And then there was the hard work, long hours, and low pay of the nation’s workers.    


In other words, South Korean businesses just got good at outcompeting their rivals.    


And then there is the Stalinist tendency of a leader to conflate his identity with that of the nation. Park is indeed guilty of this charge. His personal security chief was known to opine, “His Excellency IS the nation!” (in Korean, “각하가 곧 국가다!”)–A declaration His Excellency felt no need to correct. This ego-trip was driven by Park’s sense of mission and dedication to the nation, which unsurprisingly made him feel justifiably self-righteous, particularly in the face of the inevitable opposition to the Yushin Order.    


Autocratic leaders like Park, who see themselves as “men of destiny,” often seem to have the virtue of never giving up until their dreams come true. But when the dreams do, the virtue tends to be offset by what happens next. The world never really got to find out what would have happened next for South Korea under Park. An assassin’s bullet intervened. It is probably the case that if he had lived into the 1980s the consensus of opinion would have judged the Man of Destiny much more harshly than if he had not died in 1979. And identifying himself with the nation would have been ridiculous if it had been made only by the man and a few of his friends, but a good number of his countrymen thought the same, and many still do. So while he may not have ended up as a “pint-sized Stalin,” it is probably lucky for Park Chung-hee’s legacy that we did not get to find out what his eventual response might have been to the growing opposition to his rule if he had lived.    


It would have been a tragedy if he had made a move that might have made Uncle Joe proud.

&gt;I wanted to write these few lines today that is the Holy Easter. I usually spend it discretely but very melanchonically, without news on the family, neither from you, nobody has written to me since. This is the 4th Easter I spend behind the fences [...] I hope you all spent it well in family, I wish you every good and infinite wishes. I'm not adding much more.

I know (but I believe he meant to write I'm sorry) to hear that you can't come visit me but I hope you will be able to when the weather gets better, in a few days your brother Romeo Palladini is coming.
Dear uncle I'd like to know if you're still hearing from your brother Romeo.

Personally as a podcast listener I feel as if there's not that much else of quality in the history field, and nothing besides 'Revolutions' that is of quality and being released consistently. If you feel otherwise please let me know.

Anyway because of this I've been thinking about starting a podcast, inspired mainly by Mike Duncan, titled History of Islam. However it'll include a history of the arabs before the arrival of islam and then follow the prophets life and the states that succeeded him. I have already done a the majority research from bronze age arabs to the fall of the Umayyad Empire/Caliphate. I'm just looking for some advice on whether this something you'll be interested in and on how you prefer history podcast to be for example stylistically, length, etc.

4,Looking for Historical “Mainstream” Worries/Mistakes/Wrongs,"I’m collecting a few examples of “worrying about the wrong thing” (for lack of a better description).Things that kinda snuck up on us because we were worrying about something that turned out to be minor.  I’ll give a few examples:

Currently people are discussing the Taxi vs Uber issue. However, in 20 years all “taxi” transport might be done entirely by driverless vehicles.

Europe is panicking about a few hundred thousand refugees/immigrants. By 2050, the population of Africa will have doubled to 2.4 billion. 

From World War II to 2001, military strategists focused on the idea of global war between superpowers (possibly even nuclear) involving millions of men. The war they got was/is against a few hundred thousand irregulars. 

A few weeks before the Berlin Wall fell, Erich Honecker, the then leader of DDR, predicted the wall would stand for another 50 to 100 years (unless the outside world changed). A year later not only the wall, but the entire country was gone.

These are general examples and I’m not really interested in discussing them further. What I’m looking for is something similar.

I'm not looking for examples of persons or small groups being wrong, but in a much broader sense.

4,My grandparents were friends with a German spymaster during WWII.,"My grandmother told me a story about a man named Walter she and my grandfather had known during WWII, who turned out to be a German spy. She didn't know what happened to him after he was turned in. I was curious about him so asked her for his last name. She couldn't remember, but thought she had a picture of him somewhere with his name on the back. My aunt sent a copy of the photo and after researching his name, I believe I have identified him as a famous spymaster!

Let me first tell grandmother's story, then I will include the pics and evidence I've found. This happened during the years 1940-1943. My grandparents were living in Norfolk, VA.

My grandfather was a welder down at the Naval shipyard. Though the US was not officially at war until the end of 1941, he wanted to enlist in the military, as the US joining the war was an expected eventuality. However, he was one of only a handful of welders who were able to work on French warships that would dock for repairs, and wasn't allowed to enlist. My grandmother doesn't recall anything specific about the material or technique, she only recalls that it was something specific to repairing French ships.

Their family friend ""Spud"", whom they'd known from Illinois, got a job working for the [Civil Air Patrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Civil_Air_Patrol) doing aerial reconnaissance. He would fly out over the Atlantic and observe u-boat positions and movements and report them up the chain.

(Funny side story: my grandparents had a friend from Illinois--a young man--staying with them for some time. He was down at the beach one day and saw a u-boat surface in the distance. He ran two miles back to the apartment, non-stop, because he thought the Germans were finally invading! He had left everything at the beach and lit out for home in a panic!)

During this time, my grandmother worked at the artillery factory, packing shells for the ships. She eventually became highly ranked and oversaw the distribution and delivery of the ammunition to ships stationed on the front lines.

So both of my grandparents and their friend Spud had jobs that allowed them information that a German spy would love to be privy to. Enter Walter, who had moved into an apartment above my grandparents. He seemed like a nice man, and got on well with my grandparents and their friends. He missed his family back in Germany, and was working to provide them money and to eventually bring them to the US. They all quickly became pals and sometimes Spud would take Walter with him on the long, boring reconnaissance flights. Sometimes Walter would stop by the shipyard to bring my grandfather lunch. That kind of thing. They would all frequently go out for drinks or entertainment after work.

One day Spud went up to fetch Walter and found his apartment door was not completely closed. He called out to Walter and nobody replied, so he opened the door to check on him. Inside he saw a bunch of equipment. My grandmother said he described it as looking like communication equipment. Spud ran downstairs and told my grandfather what he had seen. My grandfather bolted upstairs and confirmed what Spud had reported. They talked for a very long time about what to do. They liked Walter very much, but they knew they had to turn him in and all that entailed. Finally they called the police, who came and arrested Walter.

Walter said he would go quietly and only requested to be able to speak to my grandparents and Spud privately before they took him away. He apologized for deceiving them, and expressed that he had become very fond of them and their friendship. He said that his wife and child would have been in great danger if he stopped spying, and that he wished he had met them under different circumstances.

They took him away in the police car and confiscated all the equipment from his apartment, and that was the last my grandparents ever knew of Walter the German spy.

Today I was given a copy of a photograph showing my grandmother with Walter, and sure enough his full name was written on the back. It was Walter Othmer.

[Front of photo](http://i.imgur.com/VXr2Db9.png)

[Back of Photo](http://i.imgur.com/uVNkKz8.png) [NB: I have removed names out of respect for my grandmother's privacy]

A quick google found a very detailed article about a German spy going by the name Walter Othmer, who was captured in Tennessee in 1944:

[The Night the FBI Collared a Nazi Spy at the YMCA](http://www.knoxmercury.com/2015/07/29/the-night-the-fbi-collared-a-nazi-spy-at-the-ymca/)

I also found an [FBI picture of Walter Othmer](https://www.fbi.gov/knoxville/image/copy_of_othmer.jpg) [[imgur mirror](http://i.imgur.com/5jsgPE7.jpg)].

Based on my grandmother's story and comparing the FBI photo with the one from my grandmother, I think they had known and befriended Maximilian Gerhard Waldemar Othmer, and that the events of 1943 mentioned in the article were a direct result of their turning him in!

&gt; In early 1943, U.S. authorities issued an “individual exclusion order” to ban Othmer from Norfolk. About the same time, there was filed a petition to cancel his U.S. citizenship.

According to the article, Othmer was actually a pretty big deal!

&gt; In the summer of 1944, in the weeks just after D-Day, the FBI was trying to root out agents of the Abwehr, Nazi Germany’s intelligence organization. Mark Felt was studying Othmer’s file in particular.

&gt; “Though Othmer claimed to be a minor agent,” Felt later wrote, “his dossier suggested he was one of the most valuable Abwehr spies in the United States.” 

Whoa!

The *Historical Dictionary of World War II Intelligence* [corroborates the article](https://books.google.com/books?id=ceIlAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=walter+othmer+spy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Spc38x_qpZ&amp;sig=ZS5mgjramc9e9taWt2aZP6QxEEE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBGoVChMI9uO42O_wxwIVyZyACh3K0gmp#v=onepage&amp;q=walter%20othmer%20spy&amp;f=false), reporting Othmer was the leader of a spy ring.

This all blew my mind and I wanted to share!


EDIT: I found a bunch of newspaper articles about the arrest, and one about a Bund meeting in 1938 mentioning Othmer.

45,Why Vietnam put an end to the Khmer Rouge regime but they are considered as invader?,"Hi guys,

Discussion for the community. Long history: 

Everyone who interests in history knows the Khmer Rouge, a horrible evil communist regime that brutally murdered 2 millions of its own people and many foreigners. Anyone has been to Cambodia must have heard the stories of S-21 prison and the ""Killing Field"". Vietnam did put an end to this Regime and set up the new government, but why they are considered to be invaders? 

**Long history:**

 The Khmer Rouge's main target were:

- Anyone related to former Cambodian government?
- Professionals and intellectuals: People who had high skill and intelligent. Those who wear glasses also got executed. Ironically, all their leaders were educated by French. 
- Thai, Vietnamese, muslim, buddhist monks, highland people, catholic people. 
- Urban dwellers due to lack of agricultural activity.

Around 1976, after Vietnam War, while Vietnam was devastated by 100 years of war, Khmer Rouge quickly excused the NVA invading them. The NVA at that time were trying to overrun the current Chinese-set-up Cambodia government and created a Vietnam-friendly government. This act was considered as an act of traitor by the Khmer Rouge. Later in April 12th, 1978, Khmer Rouge sent 2 divisions attacked a civilian village in Vietnam and massacred 3157 people, only 2 survived. Meanwhile, Khmer Rouge started murdering their own people by pushing them out of cities, killing all ""enemies"" and forcing them to slavery. Childrens were given AK-47, landmines to set.   

December 1978, Vietnam started the invasion to destroy the Khmer's Rouge force. It only takes them 2 weeks to cease Phnom Penh and push the army to Thailand's border. Khmer Rouge lost 1/2 its main force and were forced to take refuge in Thailand and deployed guerrillas warfare. Ten years into the war, the Vietnam's army and new government hold the states but the NVA began to be devastated by blockage and all their aid was sent by the Soviet. Furthermore, Vietnam also got invaded by China in 1979, resulting in heavy industrial damage in Northern region. Both sides considered ""WIN"". 

Around 1989-90, Vietnam began ""Renovation"" or known as ""Doi moi"" and withdrew their troops from Cambodia. Soon after that, all the Khmer Rouge leaders were captured by the UN and brought to court with ""crimes against humanity"". 

**End of history**

I myself has been to Cambodia and been to the Toulsleng prison. I also lost my uncle in the 1980s when his truck was hit by an RPG. And I knows people who did join the war and they told about the horrific things that they saw. How the Khmer Rouge killed children by holding their legs and smashing them to the trees. How they tortured and murdered people without a blink in the eyes. 

However when I join the international community, on some events, people still said that Vietnam invaded Cambodia and Vietnam was evil at that time and they said Vietnam should let Khmer's Rouge be. So I got really confused, so do they needed to be saved or not? And in this war, Vietnam was the bad guy in the international eyes. 

Everyone knows Khmer Rouge is bad, but they despise the force that ended Khmer Rouge too.

I knew my grandfather and grandmother fought in a war in China, but never knew it was as far back as World War II until today. Were were eating lunch and she suddenly went into her bedroom and brought out some thing to show us.

She showed me the picture of my grandpa in the military and mentioned how handsome he was and how he's wearing his uniform with the medical badge.

How they have to travel at certain times to prevent capture, blood soaked foot wrapped in hay and more... A lot of the shelters were burned down to prevent the Japanese soldiers from utilizing it when they had to abandon it. She would be walking over dead bodies everywhere, making the trail to Jinmen, China for the battle. That's when the story ended and we talked about her upcoming birthday in November.

54,"History teachers of Reddit: How are K-12 history classes changing (or how do they need to change) to reflect the fact that there's always more history ""being made""?","As I neared the end of my high school career (I graduated in 2009) it occurred to me that no history course I had ever taken really made it past WWII. I had courses on world history, American history, and European history and covered many topics multiple times throughout my public education (exploration, colonization, industrial revolution, American revolution, civil war, both world wars), but it was pretty much as if nothing ever happened before 1492 or after 1945.

Growing up, I would often hear my parents (or other people a generation before me) make references to events that occurred mere years before I was born. And I always felt rather embarrassed that I had no idea what they were talking about. In a historic sense, these events *just happened* and yet I don't know them half as well as I know the story of Hernan Cortes and the Aztecs or the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. And there's just *so much* important stuff that has happened since 1945.

Who decides what history curriculum is taught in public schools? How old do historical events have to be before they are considered the territory of public education? I never learned about the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the first Gulf War. Never learned about the moon landing or the environmental movement or Watergate. When (or will) these events become a regular part of the history class? Do school children learn about the events of September 11, 2001 already? If not, when does that become a part of history lessons?  

So basically, how do/should educators adapt their teaching to reflect the world's ever-growing history? At some point you have to leave something out, right?

My Dutch grandmother was born in Indonesia in the thirties. After Japan invaded, she and her family were put in camps. Slightly miraculously, most of them survived.

96,"Hey Reddit, can you help me understand how the Solid South turned Republican?","I've been puzzling on this question for a while, and I thought Reddit might help. For the better part of a century the eleven states that joined the Confederacy (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee - I don't count Kentucky and Missouri) voted overwhelmingly for the Democratic party. In recent decades that's reversed. How did this happen and what does it mean, for the parties and for the country? 

I hope you all will be able to fill in the gaps. Here's my quick take to get started. I graphed how many of the old Confederate states were won by the Republicans, the Democrats, and 3rd parties for every election since 1856:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gnKVF4GYp5i5pLcFmmMG06fVvxVU7i9_DsuPjiBZ3xM/edit?usp=sharing

Here are the broad strokes and highlights as I understand them. 

1856 and 1860: The new Republican party, dedicated to restricting slavery to the states where it currently exists, receives no electoral votes in those slave-holding states. In the second election the Constitutional Union party wins two states that will soon secede (Virginia and Tennessee). Also, the Democratic party that wins the rest of the soon-to-be Confederate states that year is actually a splinter from the mainline party. 

1864 to 1876: During the Civil War and Reconstruction the former Confederate states mainly vote Republican because freed slaves are given the vote and whites who served the Confederacy are often barred from voting. 

1880 to 1944: The Solid South votes Democratic. Even the apparent exception, the 1928 election, isn't really a counterexample. Hoover simply wins in a great landslide. The old Confederacy remains Republicans' weakest region. (Democratic candidate Al Smith wins seven states: South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas...and Massachusetts. That's a strange election when the Deep South and Massachusetts line up together.) 

1948 to 1976: This is the transition era. It doesn't seem to begin with Roosevelt, who still dominates in the South even in his fourth run, in spite of the decidedly non-conservative aspects of the New Deal. 

But in 1948 the Solid South starts to break down with Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrat run. Republicans capture no former Confederate states that election, but Thurmond wins four of them. 

Then in 1952 and 1956 Dwight Eisenhower wins several southern states. Both elections are landslides, however, and the South is still by far the Democrats' strongest region. 

But in 1960 another third party run complicates the picture as Harry Bird takes two southern states. And this time the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon, wins three states. This is the best showing in the South by a Republican in a non-landslide election since Reconstruction. 

Then 1964 flips the map. Texas Democrat Lyndon Johnson wins 44 states. His Republican opponent Barry Goldwater wins six: his home state of Arizona and five states from the deep South. For the first time in nearly a century, the South is not the Democrats' electoral strongpoint. 

This trend continues in 1968 as Democrat Hubert Humphrey wins only Texas, while 3rd party candidate George Wallace takes five of the remaining old Confederate states and Republican Nixon takes the other five in a highly competitive election. 

In 1972 Nixon wins every southern state, but that's not too surprising, since McGovern only wins Massachusetts. 

And then in 1976 we have one of the odder elections in American history that doesn't include a prominent 3rd party. The Democrats nominate a fairly conservative southern governor, Jimmy Carter, against the Republicans' unelected and moderate incumbent Gerald Ford. Carter's victory map looks more like Grover Cleveland's than any other Democrat's, combining an almost solid South with several northern states (and no western ones). This is very nearly the last gasp of the Democratic South. 

1980 to Present: Since Reagan the South is strongly Republican. Bill Clinton wins four ex-Confederate states both times he runs, and in 2008 Barack Obama wins two. But in 2004 John Kerry comes just 25 electoral votes short of winning the Presidency without winning a single southern state. The flip seems complete.

So what happened? As I said above, the key period clearly seems to be the years 1948 to 1976. Southern resistance to voting Republican contributed to three separate 3rd party runs by nominal Democrats (in 1948, 1960, and 1968), with Eisenhower, Goldwater, Nixon, and then Reagan steadily winning an increasing share of the southern electorate. 

But why? I'm sure there are many factors. I think it's hard to deny that race relations and civil rights played an enormous factor. It certainly helps explain why Thurmond broke with Truman in 1948 over the Democrats' civil rights plank (designed in part to appeal to the growing African-American voting communities in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic). And Johnson's successful campaign for civil rights legislation in 1963 surely contributed to Goldwater's success in the deep South in 1964. 

But that's really all I have to go on, and I suspect that there's much more to say. So, what's the rest of the story? ",history,1441593028,mrsaturdaypants,18,10,True,2015-09-06

The reason we are doing this is that hugely popular topics tends to drown out others. This is something we, and a lot of people that messaged us over time, think is a shame. By taking a short break from a subject, we hope to see a heavier focus on other aspects of history.

What this effectively means is that posts on the moratorium topics will be removed, but also some things that are directly related. For example, if the moratorium is on the US Civil War, then posts about the Confederate flag will also be removed.  
Just to be very clear, this is only for a week, and not a permanent moratorium. This month's moratorium will run from Tuesday September 1th through Tuesday September 8th.

This month's options include: 

* US Civil War (including the Confederate flag)
* Genocide Olympics (how `x` leader killed more people than `y` leader)
* Sexual History
* Poll questions such as Best, Worst, and Most Prolific
* Military History
* WWII (including the Holocaust)

58,Comparing American school textbooks over the last 100 years.,"School textbooks are a very good guide into a nation's culture at any one point in time.

I've often found the textbooks for young students to be particularly informative, because as you get older, the academic establishment becomes more cunning and more promiscuous with muddied narratives to justify what is currently being taught.

At younger ages, they don't have that luxury and as a result, you often get a more purified version of what the core beliefs are. 

So I wonder if anyone knows of any resource for a non-American to look at historical textbooks for students in, say, junior high. Preferably American history/civic text books. I'd be interested to compare what was taught - and in some ways even more interested to see what *wasn't* taught - over the past 100 years.

Is there any online resource?

87,Voyage of the Glorioso 1747: Incredible story at sea,"The Glorioso was a 70-gun ship of the line built in 1740 at Havana and served with the Royal Spanish Navy. In July, 1747 Glorioso was given the important task of transporting about 4 million silver dollars from Spanish America back to Spain. On 25 July, off the Azores, a British merchant convoy of ten British ships was there including three warships: Warwick (60), Lark(40), and a 20-gun brig. Combat ensued and Lark was severly damaged in the hull and rigging, Warwick was completely dimasted, and the brig was recalled to the convoy after an ineffectual fire exchange with the Glorioso. After this engagement the Glorioso continued sailing until it met another 3 warships, this time at Cape Finisterre. The ships were Oxford(50), Shoreham (24) and Falcon (20). After a three-hour-long fight, the three ships had suffered heavy damage, and were forced to withdraw. The Glorioso lost its bowsprit and sustained several casualties. The next day the Glorioso delivered its cargo at Corcubión (Northwestern Spain). There the crew could make necessary repairs to the ship. After the repairs were done, the Captain, Pedro de la Cerda, decided to head to Ferrol but contrary winds damaged Glorioso‍ '​s rigging and the ship was forced instead to make for Cadiz. on 17 October, she encountered a squadron of four British privateers under Commodore George Walker near Cape Saint Vincent. This squadron was called the 'Royal Family' and was composed of the frigates King George, Prince Frederick, Princess Amelia and Duke, altogether carrying 960 men and 120 guns. The flagship King George exchanged fire with the Glorioso resulting in the British frigate losing her mainmast and two guns. The Spanish and British ships duelled for three hours, taking heavy damage that forced her to break off contact. The Glorioso continued sailing to the south, being pursued by the three frigates, which were later reinforced by two ships of the line, the 50-gun HMS Dartmouth and the 92-gun HMS Russell. The Dartmouth managed to get alongside the Glorioso and after a fierce exchange of fire the British ship caught fire on her powder magazine and blew up on 8 October. The three frigates joined the Russell the following evening and together riddled the Glorioso with all their guns. The Glorioso resisted from midnight to 9 AM, when about to sink, almost completely dismasted, without ammunition, and with 33 men killed and 130 wounded on board, Captain don Pedro Messia de la Cerda, seeing that the defence was impossible, surrendered her. She was later taken by the British to Lisbon but was so heavily damaged that she had to be broken up. The commander of the ship, Pedro Messia de la Cerda, and his men, were taken to Great Britain as prisoners, but were considered heroes in Spain and gained the admiration of their enemies. Several British officers were court-martialed and expelled from the Navy for their poor performance against the enemy. All in all, the Glorioso fought 4 ships of the line, 7 frigates and 2 brigs, blowing up one ship of the line and heavily damaging the other ships and causing more than 300 casualties while sustaining 33 deaths and 130 wounded. There are many paintings representing the battles such as [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/The_Capture_of_the_%27Glorioso%27%2C_8_October_1747.jpg), [this](http://abcblogs.abc.es/tierra-mar-aire/files/2014/12/image32.jpg) and [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Glorioso_Darmouth.jpg).

88,Siege of Castelnuovo 1539: Doomed defenders,"This siege took place between 18 July and 6 August 1539 in present-day Montenegro as part of the Venetian-Ottoman wars of 1537-1540. The siege pitched 4,000 Spanish soldiers commanded by Francisco de Sarmiento against 50,000 men and 200 ships of the Ottoman Empire commanded by Barbaros Hayreddin Pasha. All of the Spanish defenders were killed but they managed to bring 24,000 Ottomans with them. What were the Spanish doing in Montenegro, you might be asking? Well, Castelnuovo was projected to be the beachhead for a great offensive against the heart of the Ottoman Empire. However, the fate of the troops who were in the fortress depended entirely on the support of the fleet, and this had been defeated by Barbarossa at Preveza before the capture of Castelnuovo. The Ottoman force arrived at Castelnuovo on 18 July and immediately began prepairing trenches and ramparts for their 44 heavy siege guns. The Spanish, meanwhile, undertook several sorties to obstruct the siege works. These raids inflicted many casualties, among them Agi, one of Barbarossa's favorite captains. Another sortie by a Spanish force of 800 men surprised several units of Janissaries who were attempting to storm the walls of Castlenuovo, killing most of them and leaving the field strewn with corpses. By 23 July the Ottomans were ready to begin the assault and sent an offer of surrender to the Spanish. They refused it. The great assault on the city was launched shortly after, and lasted all day. There were heavy casualties among the Ottomans due to both friendly fire and Spanish defending. During the night the Spanish improved their defenses and plugged the gaps opened in the walls. When the attack was resumed the next morning, Saint James Day, Bishop Jeremías remained with the soldiers, encouraging them and confessing those who were mortally wounded along the attacked perimeter. About 6,000 Ottoman soldiers were killed in the bloody assault, while the Spanish suffered only 50 killed. The next morning, while the Ottomans were still asleep, 600 Spaniards decided to conduct an 'encamisada' (basically, sneak into the enemy camp and kill as many sleeping soldiers as possible before they realize what's happening, then you run back). Many troops broke and ran, including some Janissaries who fled throughout their own camp breaking down the tents, including that of Barbarossa. During the following days most of the artillery concentrated its fire on a fort in the upper town. The remaining cannons, meantime, continued firing at the fragile walls of the town. On 4 August, Barbarossa ordered an assault against the ruins of the fort, which was now completely shattered, with its casemates ruined. As a major point of the defense, Sarmiento had reinforced the garrison and removed the wounded in the preceding days. The assault began at dawn and the battle lasted all day. Captain Machín of Munguía distinguished himself in the fight, leading the defenders with great courage. By nightfall the remnants of the Spanish garrison retreated to the walls of the town with their wounded, leaving the ruined castle in Barbarossa's hands. The day was very costly in lives. On 5 August a new attack was launched against the walls. Barbarossa was sure that he could soon capture Castelnuevo. All the Janissaries took part in the action, and the cavalry was ordered to dismount to join the general assault. Despite the overwhelming numerical superiority of the Ottoman troops, the Spanish defense was successful, as no more than a tower of the wall fell to the besiegers that day. The last and definitive attack took place the next morning. Francisco de Sarmiento, on horseback, was wounded in the face by three arrows, but he continued to encourage his men. Demolished by heavy gunfire, the ruins of the walls became indefensible. Sarmiento then ordered the 600 Spanish survivors to retreat. His idea consisted of defending a castle in the lower city where the civilian population of Castelnuovo had taken refuge. Although the withdrawal was made in perfect order and discipline, Sarmiento and his men found that the doors of the castle were walled at their arrival. After refusing a rope offered to raise him to the walls, he joined Machín de Munguía, Juan Vizcaíno and Sancho Frias to lead the last stand. Surrounded by the Ottoman army, the last Spanish soldiers fought back to back until none were able to fight. At the end of day, Castelnuovo was in Ottoman hands.

I subsequently completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne studying the Rothschild Prayer Book and related manuscripts. 

I’ve since been interviewed by various media including Channel 7 and Radio National as well as being featured in University of Melbourne’s Voice: http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/voice/rare-books-shining-moment-20150806-40kzy.html

I’m delivering a public lecture next week to provide an intimate look into the Rothschild Prayer Book: http://go.unimelb.edu.au/x9aa. But before that lecture, I’m giving you all the opportunity to ask me anything you like about the Rothschild Prayer Book (or related manuscripts)! I look forward to sharing my research with you.

83,An infographic on Medieval Development [France vs. the Holy Roman Empire].,"Hello /r/History! As part of a summer program offered by my school (Which ended last week) I was given the opportunity to develop my own Infographic on anything I feel passionate about. For me, that was Medieval History, specifically the question of ""Why did France centralize while the Holy Roman Empire remain feudal / fragmented?"". 

My instructor brought to my attention [this](http://www.earthlymission.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/histomap_the_relative_power_of_nations.jpg) histogram, which I used for the second half of the infographic (Note that the histogram linked is vague about its data and sources, so take it with a grain of salt) I next read up on the institutional differences between France and Germany, and developed two flowcharts showing those differences in development. 

Finally, I put it all together in Inkscape to create my Final project, linked below.

21,"(ex)Soviet Leader, Yuri Andropov's response to Samantha Smith's letter regarding US-USSR relations c. April 26th 1983","Dear Samantha,


I received your letter, which is like many others that have reached me recently from your country and from other countries around the world.


It seems to me – I can tell by your letter – that you are a courageous and honest girl, resembling Becky, the friend of Tom Sawyer in the famous book of your compatriot Mark Twain. This book is well known and loved in our country by all boys and girls.


You write that you are anxious about whether there will be a nuclear war between our two countries. And you ask are we doing anything so that war will not break out.


Your question is the most important of those that every thinking man can pose. I will reply to you seriously and honestly.

Yes, Samantha, we in the Soviet Union are trying to do everything so that there will not be war on Earth. This is what every Soviet man wants. This is what the great founder of our state, Vladimir Lenin, taught us.

Soviet people well know what a terrible thing war is. Forty-two years ago, Nazi Germany, which strove for supremacy over the whole world, attacked our country, burned and destroyed many thousands of our towns and villages, killed millions of Soviet men, women and children.

In that war, which ended with our victory, we were in alliance with the United States: together we fought for the liberation of many people from the Nazi invaders. I hope that you know about this from your history lessons in school. And today we want very much to live in peace, to trade and cooperate with all our neighbors on this earth — with those far away and those near by. And certainly with such a great country as the United States of America.

In America and in our country there are nuclear weapons — terrible weapons that can kill millions of people in an instant. But we do not want them to be ever used. That's precisely why the Soviet Union solemnly declared throughout the entire world that never — never — will it use nuclear weapons first against any country. In general we propose to discontinue further production of them and to proceed to the abolition of all the stockpiles on Earth.

It seems to me that this is a sufficient answer to your second question: 'Why do you want to wage war against the whole world or at least the United States?' We want nothing of the kind. No one in our country–neither workers, peasants, writers nor doctors, neither grown-ups nor children, nor members of the government–want either a big or 'little' war.

We want peace — there is something that we are occupied with: growing wheat, building and inventing, writing books and flying into space. We want peace for ourselves and for all peoples of the planet. For our children and for you, Samantha.

I invite you, if your parents will let you, to come to our country, the best time being this summer. You will find out about our country, meet with your contemporaries, visit an international children's camp – Artek – on the sea. And see for yourself: in the Soviet Union, everyone is for peace and friendship among peoples.

Thank you for your letter. I wish you all the best in your young life.

22,How Churchill Caused The Great Depression and Keynesian Revolution -- and How Keynes Tried To Stop Him,"[Article](https://mises.org/library/how-keynes-almost-prevented-keynesian-revolution)

The argument is that Churchill returned the pound to the gold standard in 1925 at an overvalued rate, which led to problems in Britain. Then came pressure on the US Fed to drive down interest rates to take the pressure off the British. This, according to an economist cited in the article, gave fuel to the Wall Street Bubble. 

I'm not sure how strong the next part of the argument is. It says that, the economic catastrophe which resulted set the stage for the Keynesian Revolution. This is supported in the article by a quote from Keynes' biographer. But I personally think the Keynesian Revolution was probably inevitable -- just like the discovery of gravity or any other scientific advance. 

Any thoughts?

48,Questions from PhD student (History) to History teachers (high school/JC),"Hi everyone,


I am a PhD student in History in California at a public university. For many years I worked with the goal of becoming a professor of History, but I am now giving that dream up after closely watching the market for 36 months.


I am planning on becoming a high school social studies teacher, and teaching at the community college level in summers to supplement my income. I have a few questions for you kind folks and I'd appreciate any feedback.


1. What is the current condition of the job market in California (and also in your state) for social studies teachers? A year ago I was reading strong reports on population explosions out here increasing the demand for teachers. Because students must take 3-4 years of history/social studies in California, those teachers were at least in some demand. Now, I'm reading that the market is slugging again.


2. I'm looking at teaching credential programs in California. Does it matter where I get one? Are they all equal? I already have an MA in History so I don't want to do the education MA as well (mostly because of the loans). So far, I'm loan free.


3. How can I make myself more competitive for the social studies job market? I have a BA in European History, an MA in American History, 4 years of teaching experience at the university and junior college levels, and my teaching sub-field is World History. I'm also willing to teach politics/government/civs, but I'm a little uneasy about those. I have strong leadership/speaking qualities, and my degrees are from a respectable university. I'm also young and still somewhat bushy-tailed. 


4. What other advice would you give me? I was told I should also do the CSET in ESL, Health, English, or some other field.


5. When is the best time to look for teaching jobs? I'm not sure when Edjoin posts all of their jobs but I occasionally poke around, and usually there are about 20 listings for social studies/hist teachers.

54,"I want to learn more about China's history, specifically ancient China","I first learned about China in world history last year, but I learned next to nothing, just the names of the many dynasties and the dates. However, since then I have been really interested, from the Xia dynasty that may not have existed, to the many ancient dynasties, to the Mongol's rule with Genghis Kahn, all the way to Mao Zedong and communist China.

I just find it so fascinating how long and rich China's history is, and how you can focus on one small part, like a dynasty, then look at one ruler from that dynasty, and spend a ton of time researching him. 

I want to learn more, and watch documentaries and videos, look at paintings, and become an expert at ancient China. I have no idea why, it just seems really cool to me.

I've looked at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China) link a lot, but I want more! What are some good documentaries, books, podcasts, and things of that nature I can use to learn more? Also, when I get to college, would there be any classes on something like this?

75,Found my Grandfathers WWII Duffel bag (link to album in post),"My grandfather passed away a few months back.  He was drafted into the US Navy and fought in the pacific theater of WWII.  He never talked about it much, but as he got older a few stories would slip out.  The more he told the more I began to understand why he didn't want to talk about it much.  He was a radio technician who would be sent to the front (in this case on a beach) after the first wave of soldiers secured the beachhead so he could radio the ships for more reinforcements and supplies.  


I know for sure that he was at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  He would tell stories about him and his buddies would sleep while holding their rifle because Japanese soldiers would frequently sneak into camp and try to kill US soldiers in their sleep.  He also told me stories about how Japanese soldiers would hide in holes/tunnels all over the island and the US soldiers would throw grenades into the holes and later pull out and stack the bodies.


He always said he never came back with anything, that he got rid of it when he got back to California, and especially didn’t have any need for a gun or rifle.  So to my surprise while cleaning out the garage at his house I found his Navy duffel bag and a rifle.  After doing some research I was able to learn a bit about the rifle and some of the other memorabilia.  I’m thinking about trying to restore the rifle, but that’s another project for another day.  Everything that was his had his last name or initials on it.  Each part of the tent displayed his name in various places as well as manufacturer information.


**Contents of the ‘Lucky Bag’ (link below):**

**His US Navy gear:**  
2 Gas masks – they were unused (still had the seal/tag) and were in their own bags  
Helmet Bayonet – I’m assuming it was for his rifle  
2 ammo clips in a belt clip/pouch  
2 field first aid kits  
Mess kit – you can see some tape on it with writing, the only thing I could make out was my grandmother’s name  
Pouch that looks like it held a radio  
Belt  
Navy issued swim trunks  
Tent – poles, stakes, tent, rain fly, rope  
Backpack – it doesn’t actually have any pouches/pockets, it completely unfolds and looks like you can attach everything to it to carry.  
A few other pieces of material/cloths that I couldn’t figure out what they were for

**Japanese Military/Navy memorabilia:**  
Type 99 Rifle (missing mechanism to load bullets but everything else still works)  
Navy hat  
Navy shirt  
Pouch with writing on it  
Pin – name tag?  
Some kind of Navy flag/banner Navy patch – looks like it has the rank on there
*I’m going to post a couple pictures of this stuff to /r/translator to see what it says


That’s pretty much it.  I’m still cleaning out the garage/basement/work shop so who knows what else I’ll find, especially after he would tell us he never kept anything from the war.


Here’s a picture of my grandfather (left) before he was shipped off to the war. Also in the picture is his brother (right) and his mother, my great-grandmother (center). - http://i.imgur.com/bucJTIJ.jpg

China currently has 252 national levelold towns, including 10 in Shanghai, and276 national level ancient villages with two in Shanghai.

“The biggest dilemma the city’s old towns face are the developers, who are keen to build faux-old commercial streets in the towns to make quickmoney, leaving the truly old and originalarchitecture aside,” said Ruan Yisan, aTongji University professor and director of China’s Ancient Architecture ResearchCenter.

“The prevailing logic is that you need to develop tourism and boost the economy to protect these towns, which is so sad. If money is the ultimate goal and when the end justifies the means, those old houses we want to preserve will be the victims.”

The city’s cultural heritage buildings are protected by laws, but enforcement is patchy. Some heritage buildings are rebuilt while others are destroyed to make way for new developments.

3,Humfrey Barwick's Arguments in favor of Muskets and Arquebuses over the Longbow (1592),"From [A Breefe Discourse, Concerning the force and effect of all manuall weapons of fire, and the disability of the Long Bowe or Ar∣chery, in respect of others of greater force now in vse.](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A05277.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext) by Humfrey Barwick, an English soldier who served as a mercenary in France and Spain During the late 16th century. This is a treatise he wrote in order to use his military experience to set the record straight about the effectiveness of firearms compared to bows. In particular he wanted to correct those in England who still held that the bow was superior, such as Sir John Smythe.

[A more English Translation of the first 9 discourses](http://the-norseman.livejournal.com/13230.html?nojs=1)

The following is me trying to transcribe all the main points he makes pertaining to guns vs longbows:

-The harquebus requires a lot of training to use properly, many English do not trust it yet because they are not yet used to the weapon.

-The Spanish have a great deal of yew, if the longbow was that the spanish would have adopted it by now.

-The English are overly attached to the longbow due to their history and culture.

-Most of the great longbow victories Sir John Smythe lists happened over 200 years ago.

-In the past battles usually devolved into melees, now they are usually decided at range with positioning and fire.

-Noble men can't understand the effect of weapons as well as common soldiers do. Particularly those who use firearms since those professions are considered beneath noblemen.

-An instance where Captain Brode claims a harquebuser can fire only 10 shots an hour, Barwick offers to demonstrate firing 40 shots in that same amount of time.

-If loaded properly with good powder, a musket will kill a man in proofed armor at 200 yards, common armor at 400 yards, and an unarmored man at 600 yards.

-Sir John Smythe's concerns about bullets not being properly sized to their weapon or the powder/match getting wet are not a problem if skilled soldiers are using the weapons.

-If the weather is so wet that everything gets damp then it is also a disadvantage for the other side. In this case the soldiers can either wait it out or engage in melee.

-Responding to John Smythe's claims that the longbow was uncomparibly more accurate than firearms, Barwick points out that he two practiced with the longbow until he was 17 and was a good shot, but after 4 or 5 months of practice with his harquebus he believed he could shoot more accurately than the best bowman in England.

-A gun can be more easily aimed and steadied than a bow or crossbow, especially with a stand.

-Sir John Smythe claims that harquebusers would never shoot at a target more than 8, 10 or 12 yards, Barwick counters that no skilled soldier would fail to hit a target the size of a dinner plate at that range

-All soldiers know how to judge the range of a target and adjust their sight accordingly.

-Barwick claims he has never seen anyone slain outright by an arrow and only a few by crossbow quarrels, but has seen 20,000 killed by gunshots.

-Barwick describes a conversation with a french soldier where he tries to defend the strength of the longbow, the frenchman in unimpressed since even the weakest man with a firearm is more powerful than the strongest archer.

-When Barwick attempts to defend the longbow by bring up its hail of arrows, the French soldier responds that he only need to tilt his head forward to protect his face and he has nothing to fear from the arrows.

-Barwick discusses the siege of Lieth in which 448 English soldiers were killed. When he asked how many of the defenders were killed by arrows he learns that there were none over the course of the entire siege, except for one man who was still recovering from his wound.

-A loaded firearm may be fired more quickly than a nocked arrow may be drawn and loosed.

-If musketeers really did wait until 8-12 yards like Sir John Smythe claims, then they would not have time to discharge their weapons against charging cavalry.

-There is no archer who can shoot more than 2 arrows for every 1 bullet from a well trained harquebuser.

-Musketeers can deliver their first volley at 480 yards, and then deliver another volley every time the enemy has advanced 80 yards.

-Bowmen cannot start shooting until the enemy is within 160 yards.

-A gun will deliver more bullets with greater force than a bow can whether in the short term or the long term. At close range the harquebusers may load an extra shot into their weapons and fire two at once.

-At close range, firearms are aimed by rule, while bows are aimed by guesswork.

-while guns sometimes misfire, Archers frequently become stressed and fail to draw their arrows back all the way.

-If an archer is not well fed or has stiff joints from sleeping in the cold he can become too weak to draw his bow.

-in wet weather, the glue on a bow and it's arrows may dissolve.

-firearms are far more feared and 100 men are killed by them for every 1 killed by arrows.

-arrows rarely kill, and only wound in the face and unarmored places.

-Sir John Smythe claims that arrowheads are left to rust so that their wounds become infected, Barwick admits to seeing many archers with rusty arrowheads, but says that rusty arrows cannot penetrate even a padded doublet.

-England's lack of skilled musketeers makes it vulnerable to invaders.

-Humfrey Barwick proposes a challenge where the best archer in England stands at 120 yards and shoots 10 arrows at him before he returns fire with 2 shots from a musket or harquebus.",history,1439013504,hborrgg,3,11,True,2015-08-08

61,How effective was combat armor since Ancient times?,"Throughout history how really effective was armor in protecting soldiers?

When considering how the English longbow men defeated French Knights during the Hundred Years War, it makes you wonder was there much point in wearing armor when fighting archers? In 1139 Pope Innocent II declared using crossbows against Christians immoral. In general chainmail didn't give good protection against piercing weapons. How often were bows used by peasants? The peasants wouldn't have to be good shots if fighting in a formation? If they were fighting Knights the horses would still be vulnerable.

Shields seemed to be more effective against arrows and javelins considering the Roman Testudo formation and the Anglon Saxon shield walls being very effective at the Battle of Hastings until the Norman archers shot at a higher angle. Hoplites &amp; phalanx pikemen seemed to have very good protection from missile weapons when facing enemies from the front, Alexander The Great's successes seems to prove this. In videogames, shields are more effective than armor at blocking arrows. Was Cataphract Armor highly effective against bows for it's time? The Mongols main weapon were their advanced compound bows. High levels of discipline, practically no need for a supply train, and their advanced bows made them the most effective army in history.

Also if it was windy or rainy, would Knights be at an advantage fighting archers, assuming the mud wouldn't slow them down very much? 

Fast forward to WW II the armor on most tanks, besides the Soviet T 34 , KV 1&amp;2, the French Char B-1, and the British Matilda II; didn't give good protection against most tank and AT guns at the time. The hulls of many tanks at the time were riveted, so MG fire hitting the rivets could send them flying inside the tank killing the crew. The 34-85 and long barreled Shermans could pen the sides of Panthers and Tigers easily.  How effective is the armor on modern tanks? TOW missiles, can completely destroy a T-72 from miles away. From what I understand, reactive armor is effective against only one hit; so even an Abrams, Challenger 2, or T-90 probably wouldn't have a much better chance surviving a hit from a TOW missile, once their reactive armor would be detonated.

I spoke with local police officers before, they told me that the vests they wear don't give much protection against anything bigger than a .22 round. How effective are standard military kevlar vests at stopping AK 47 rounds at average combat ranges? All these questions and scenarios make you wonder how really effective combat armor was since the ancient times.",history,1439105941,corehazard,22,9,True,2015-08-09

92,The Time Poetry Saved the World,"So here's a fun little history lesson about the power of literature and poetry in wartime:

During the Crimean War, there was a famous incident known today as ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"". It took place at the Siege of Sevastopol, during the Battle of Balaclava when, due to miscommunication, 600 mounted British cavalry charged dug-in Russian artillery head-on.

Only 129 came back. Russian commanders later said it was ""not war, but madness"". They assumed the brits must have been drunk.

The incident would soon be brought to the attention of the British public when Lord Alfred Tennyson published the poem ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"", which you can read here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade_(poem)

In this poem, Tennyson praises the martyrdom and valor of the brigade, and condemns the military brass who sent them to die. And in the weeks after, in response to Tennyson's poem, so did the public — there were hearings, inquests, and public demonstrations. At one such incident, 1500 British citizens gathered in Trafalgar Square to protest the war by pelting pedestrians, busses, and even the police with snowballs, before being put down with truncheons. People were pissed.

Flash forward.

It's one year later, and now there's ANOTHER conflict near Sevastopol: The Battle of the Chernaya.

Present at this battle? 

Why, none other than Mr. Leo Tolstoy.

And yet again, there's an ill-fated offensive charge owing to miscommunication along the chain-of-command and resulting in the slaughter of hundreds of men — but this time, the charge is by the Russians!

Tolstoy, who took part in and survived this charge, wrote about it in his ""Sevastopol Sketches"", a literary account of events that was so scurrilous and critical of command that Russian brass deemed the text ""anti-patriotic"" and censored large passages. But the damage was done: the public was outraged, and it's said that even the Russian Empress, upon reading Tolstoy's work, broke down and wept.

Tolstoy also wrote a song about the event, which (in the manner that such things could, in those days) essentially went viral. Tolstoy's ""Song of Sevastopol"", as translated by historian Henri Troyat, reads as follows:



♪ The toppest brass

Sat down to meet

And pondered long;

Topographers

Lined paper black

But all forgot

The deep ravine

They had to cross!♫



So what we have here is two disastrous military maneuvers, both owing to an error in communication, made by opposite sides in the same war, at the same place, less than one year apart. Both incidents result in a piece of literature by an historic writer, fiercely critical of his own nation's military command and begging an end to the conflict. Both works achieve mass popularity, and both works incite public outcry over the war — from opposite peoples on opposite sides.

One year later, the Crimean War is ended, with the signing of the treaty of Paris.

Now you might say this was just coincidence. You might marvel at the abilities of the artist, to dredge beauty out of travesty, and call it a day at that.

Alternatively, and much more awesomely, you might say that Alfred Tennyson and Leo Tolstoy, together through the power of literature, ended the Crimean War.",history,1439158641,BMCarbaugh,1,10,True,2015-08-09

The reason we are doing this is that hugely popular topics tends to drown out others. This is something we, and a lot of people that messaged us over time, think is a shame. By taking a short break from a subject, we hope to see a heavier focus on other aspects of history.

What this effectively means is that posts on the moratorium topic will be removed, but also some things that are directly related. For example, if the moratorium is on the US Civil War, then posts about the Confederate flag will also be removed.  
Just to be very clear, this is only for a week, and not a permanent moratorium. This month's moratorium will run from Tuesday August 4th through Tuesday August 11th.

This month's options include: 

* US Civil War (including the Confederate flag)
* Genocide Olympics (how `x` leader killed more people than `y` leader)
* Sexual History
* Poll questions such as Best, Worst, and Most Prolific
* Military History

70,"Guns, Germs, and Steel -- I was not impressed with the quality of the argument or scholarship","I just finally got around to reading this book, after hearing about it over a decade ago from a Yale department head during dinner at his place. He loved the book. I know there's been a lot of threads about this book, some positive and some negative. But I don't recall any that talk about the fact that the book's entire premise seems flawed.

The premise of the book is that European civilization dominates the world due to several lucky 'accidents' of history, including most prominently the early development and spread of agriculture in parts of Eurasia. It's meant as a refutation that Europeans are inherently biologically 'superior'.

But it doesn't work for me. First, and worst overall, is the attitude that world history represents steady 'progress' toward the current state. Thus, current European domination is the result of 'progress'. I think that's just as offensive as saying Europeans are biologically superior, especially since there are so many examples of longer-lasting civilizations in the world. Just because we are currently living in a world shaped by relatively recent European militarism and colonialism doesn't mean that this state is the world's 'destiny'. What about East Asian civilizations that have been around a lot longer? Diamond (the book author) seems to declare Europeans the victor of world history, when Europeans have only been 'on top' for a relatively short while. 

The whole book seems like a strained ex post facto excuse to explain why Europeans were 'destined' to dominate the world. If early development of agriculture leads to eventual domination, then why didn't middle-eastern countries and cultures dominate the world? And if Eurasian agriculture was always destined to dominate, then why are most of the [world's current most important food crops](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-crops-that-feed-the-world-2011-9?op=1) NOT natives of the 'fertile crescent'? 

The book seems to act like progression toward 'advanced' (European) culture and dominance is inevitable. But it ignores its own examples, like Australian aboriginals that supposedly 'regressed' after migration from mainland Asia. And it ignores European cultures that interacted with others for a long time without asserting dominance. The Norse had settlements in North America that lasted longer than the time between Christopher Columbus and now!

If European systems are so 'inevitable', then why did one of the most 'advanced' and currently World dominant political systems arise only after contact with and inspiration from Native American systems? Could it be that the books Eurocentric view is wildly simplistic?

It's like a typical American's warped view of world history as taught by bad American high school history books focusing on the 'progress' and 'inevitability' of our current world. 

Honestly, I think the book is incredibly racist, in that it simplistically  highlights one culture (North European) as inevitably most advanced and therefore properly destined for world domination. Worse it's not even a convincing argument. It keeps saying that Europeans dominate because of agriculture and domestication and developments that mostly occurred *elsewhere*. It invokes Eurasian geography again and again to explain why all these marvelous advances came to Europe. But there is no explanation for why South central Asia didn't dominate. Or East Asia. Or North Africa. Well, in fact all these places have vibrant civilizations that have been around longer than European 'civilization', but which Diamond (the author of GG&amp;S) seems to think are somehow less advanced cultures that inevitably fell by the wayside in favor of European dominance. It's crazy and insulting.

Again -- I think this book is popular because white people in power like to hear that they were destined to rule. Is there a difference between saying 'by the Grace of God' and 'by lucky accidents of world history'?

35,Help with books to read,"Hi everyone,

I was planning to study Psychology, and I still am, but since taking some International studies courses, I plan on double majoring in Economics. During those courses I read The Communist Manifesto, Ellen Woods' Origin of Capitalism, King Leopold's Ghost by Adam Horschsild, The Protestant Ethic by Max Weber, And Vermeer's Hat by Timothy Brook. In preparation for my Study Abroad program I am reading Nelson Mandela's Long Walk to Freedom, Steve Biko's I write what I like, and White Supremacy: A comparative Study by George Fredrickson. I Really enjoy learning about history through the more personal stories, or at least through analytical critique. Both Adam Horchsild and Timothy Brook seem to really care for making the material equally engaging as informative, I would really like to read similar styles in different areas of knowledge.  

I would really appreciate if someone here could recommend some history books to me, preferably something in the Audible catalogue. I have realized that my newfound interest in history is competing with my obvious lack of general knowledge of history. 

The first thing I need is to brush up on My US history. Ideally something that goes from the french revolution up through the 1900's or so, but I'm sure that someone who knows what they are talking about could give a better suggestion. 

Really, any suggestion for a good read that is also informative is welcome. I signed up for audible to get through some of these course readings as I really like listening to them while I do chores, do my hobby things, etc. ",history,1437843728,[deleted],0,1,True,2015-07-25

I'm posting to r/history today because I was at my local thrift store today rummaging through things when I saw four small note book looking things. I opened them up to find they were film negatives. The first two books looked to be 35mm and the other two i think were either 120 or 125? who knows. I held a negative up to the light and the first picture was a man standing in a military uniform. I ended up buying the books because I like investigating random things. When I got home to really investigate I started looking for clues to date and location. There is no writing in the 35mm books at all so I just had to go by looking at the pictures(there are about 300 of them). What I figured out so far is the photos were taken in the late 1940s early 1950s. The majority of the 35mm books are either in japan or korea based on asian people everywhere and women in kimonos. A lot of pictures are on base with pictures of people drinking, playing guitar, playing with dogs etc. etc. One of the signs from what I could make out was 24th infantry division entrance. there are a lot of pictures of vehicles as well that look like this http://imgur.com/Ik1S40X also larger cargo trucks im guessing. There are also pictures of people in full gear with guns but i couldnt really make a lot out due to the negatives being tiny. Now as I move on to the 120, 125 sized pictures(there are about 95 of them) I noticed the front page has writing. There are no dates but is listed like this. 

Negatives 1-7: Signs of NY one of the pictures was a picture of this http://imgur.com/gmqHf2B

Negatives 8 - 10: Ft lewis wash(pictures of people in uniform)
Negatives 11 - 15: Boat going to japan(again men in uniform on a boat) 
Negatives 16 - 30:Japan, CP weir(i'm assuming thats a name because there is pictures of the same guy with other men) 
Negatives 31 - 38:Motor pool korea(pictures of land, vehicles and people) 
Negatives 39 - 50: Elrita H.C. (pictures of a lady who i'm guessing is named Elrita. She has a baby in some pics) 

The second books has the same list but different pictures and one new location which is ft Dixon new jersey.

These pictures are great and probably have a lot of history in them that I feel like some people would like to see. Maybe someone can find a family member who knows!

Amazon gives a good description of the book:

&gt;In his fifth work of nonfiction, Mark Kurlansky turns his attention to a common household item with a long and intriguing history: salt. The only rock we eat, salt has shaped civilization from the very beginning, and its story is a glittering, often surprising part of the history of humankind. A substance so valuable it served as currency, salt has influenced the establishment of trade routes and cities, provoked and financed wars, secured empires, and inspired revolutions.  Populated by colorful characters and filled with an unending series of fascinating details, Salt by Mark Kurlansky is a supremely entertaining, multi-layered masterpiece.

There's still plenty of time to get the book (first discussion thread is on the 20th), and I've uploaded the intro and first chapter as pdf already, if you want to get a head start.

Hope to see some of you over there!

38,Fourth of July Television: Inaccurate Historical Dramas.,"Right now HBO 2 just finished part 1 of the 7-part mini-series John Adams and History Channel is showing part 1 of the Sons of Liberty. Can't get too excited though -- both of these dramas are pretty loose with the facts. 

Sons of Liberty is an especially egregious affront on reality -- all of a sudden Samuel Adams is a 25-year old hunk running from red-coats on rooftops as he leaves the bar. John Adams is not nearly as bad, but still is not good. They portray Sam Adams as tarring and feathering Brits (which he almost assuredly never did) among other annoyances. 

Here is an article about the folly of History Channel's ""Sons of Liberty"" from the Journal of the American Revolution: http://allthingsliberty.com/2015/01/discover-the-truth-behind-history-channels-sons-of-liberty-series/

And for John Adams: This is a pretty good essay about some of the liberties taken for dramatic purposes in John Adams. This series is much more regarded as a piece of drama (HBO vs History -- not a surprise) but still would leave one with some wrong ideas about how things went down in colonial America in the late 18th century: http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/48493

I suppose it is still better than History 2 which is using this holiday to have a show about haunted houses. 

Is there any historical dramas that try a little harder to be accurate?

""The June 28 victory stood as a kind of physical Declaration, an early sign of the American capacity to oppose the British at arms. As historian Edward C. Bearss has observed: ""So far in 1776 General Washington had accomplished little beyond hurrying Howe's evacuation of Boston. The American army sent to overrun and occupy Canada had collapsed. Now came word of a victory from the south. Not only had the British been repulsed before Sullivan's Island, but they had given up their initial attempt to carry the war to the southern colonies.""

""The upsetting of British plans in the South helped win uncommitted Americans to the struggle for independence. It also enabled the Southern colonies to support vital campaigns in the north.

However, I don't think he deserves to be one of history's greatest generals as people often call him. It's true he conquered most of the known world, took down the massive Persian Empire and all within the short span of his life.

But, I'd say his defeat of the Persian Empire relies more on the utter incompetence of Darius III. Arguably his two greatest battles, the Battle of Issus and the battle of Gaugamela, were for the most part won because of Darius III being a horrible military commander and fleeing the field in the middle of both battles. The Persian army was mostly made up of levies, and without their king to lead them they broke and were massacred by the Macedonians. These two pivotal battles saw Alexander gain the majority of his Empire.

I realize Alexander won many other battles not against Darius, such as the Battle of the Hydaspes. He certainly proved himself to be a master of tactics, but I don't think he deserves to be one of history's greatest. Napoleon, Subutai, Alexander Suvorov, Zhang Xun, and many others are greater commanders than him in my opinion. They faced much stronger foes and won even when all odds were against them.

If anyone disagrees with me, please go ahead. It's possible I'm just not seeing Alexander's true genius, I posted this because I think he's overrated but its entirely possible I'm wrong. ",history,1434791219,_Basileus,18,28,True,2015-06-20

Starting in French Indochina, the first half of this episode gives an overview of the efforts of the French to maintain colonial control in that region. Their defeat sets the stage for conflict in Algeria, where France was determined not to lose control of what they considered part of Metropolitan France. The latter half of the podcast covers key Algerian grievances, the formation of the FLN, and early actions on both sides, concluding with Phillipeville.

98,"Is there a career or path that could combine my interests of Philosophy, History, Fine Art, Botany/Nature and Writing?? (Any combination of two or more).","Hello everyone,

I'm a third year Fine Arts student who is finishing their course this year. I've enjoyed the course, but I've found that;

(A) I don't (and won't within the next year) have enough finances to support any sort of artistic practice.

(B) I've really just kind of lost interest in the whole 'Postmodernism and Conceptual Art' premise. Look..I love looking at abstract concepts and alternate ways of thinking...but it kind of annoys me when people put traditional painting and someone stripping themselves naked and pouring melted butter on themselves in the same category.

(C) You would think Art school would be somewhere where people would be trying to find out new ideas right? NOPE. It's just a bunch of 40-something mature age women and 20-something women working part time that draw scribbles of skulls and flowers all day.

(D) There's a huge lack of funding in the Fine Art world, so success is not impossible...but pretty slim considering your work has to fit some institution's ""canon"". Aka...they want you to base your work off someone else's just so they can write it down on a document for curating so it ""makes sense"".

Anyway those are my reasons. And no it's not a sob story..just some notes about what I've observed from my perspective.

So I was thinking about combining Philosophy and Ancient History especially...but I'm really not sure what they could fit into. Across the internet and in real life, people keep telling me that there are no jobs there, and that those degrees are ""useless"". I'm also not sure because I live in Australia, where people tend to focus less on the past and on ethics...and more on contemporary events because we hardly have much of a history XD

Anyway, please comment if you can, that would be greatly appreciated!!",history,1434940586,GreyCavalier78,13,4,True,2015-06-21

Hi Evereyone - thanks for taking part in the discussion. I see that some people are confused by the title, so lets put a couple of new scenarios:

Scenario 1 -  You manage to assemble, through use of a time machine/washing machine/police call box, one person from each century. All in one room. You start with the most recent - a guy called Andy - and tell him ""Andy from 2015, please tell Edward the following message ""Do you want something to eat?"" and to pass it on to the next person."" Andy from 2015 tells that to Edward from 1915, who then tells Arthur from 1815 ""Arthur, my good man, would you care for something to eat?"" 1815 Arthur then turns to his new girlfriend Mary 1715 saying ""Oh Mary! Wouldst you like something to nourish you?"" Mary 1715 turns to Thomas 1615 and passes on the message, who then passes it on to Jane 1515 to Ralph 1415 and so on until you get to a charming fellow by the name of Brutus, Roman Consul and founder of Britain way back in the day. Well, at what point would the person passing that same message not be able to communicate with the next person in line?

Scenario 1a - what do you think would be the best message to pass, and in what form?

Scenario 2 - A mother in 800 BC Danebury, Hampshire, British Isles, Earth, tells her young daughter to ""fetch the eggs, love, I'm hungry"" in whatever language they spoke. The daughter, when herself a mother, tells her daughter the same message. On and on until you get 2015 Samantha telling her daughter Beyoncexz something similar. Obviously the message would be able to pass from one to the other, though the language would change. How many languages would it go through and would it be a very gradual change?



PS, how do I cross post this to the linguists?",history,1434291294,Zenn_diagram,268,1248,True,2015-06-14

This propaganda piece featured many prominent Nazi party figures and other figures related to the buildup to World War 2.

My Great-Grandfather was a German immigrant to the US, and after living in the US for a few years, he sent for his wife to leave Germany as well. Her family sent with her this book, basically meant to say to my Great-Grandfather, ""Hey, look at this schmuck."" Little did they know however, how much of an impact that schmuck would have.

I'm vacationing to Washington DC this week, and my dad gave me this book to donate to the Holocaust Museum, which he had meant to do for some time. Though it would be publicly available there, I took pictures of its pages so that you all could see it without having to travel to DC yourselves, and so that you could see this little bit of German history.

Spends next two years training for it. Meets a young woman who handles all the signals for the high command and they fall in love. Although she can't tell him, she knows the projected casualty rate for D-Day so tells him they're getting married prior to the invasion (he still claims he had no say in that :-P). Lands at Juno Beach with the Canadians. You'll have to read it for the rest.**

*My best friend's grandad (who was like my adopted grandad when I was growing up) was one of the first ashore on D Day. A few years ago he wrote his memoirs, and given that today is the anniversary of the landings I thought some might find it interesting so I've typed it all out for you (the original was done on his very elderly typewriter).  Fred is in his 90s now and is still spry and active despite having been widowed a few years ago. He spends his days making wooden toys for children's charities. He's a true gentleman, utterly charming with a wicked sense of humour, and just a delightful human being.*



**Background**

In October 1942 I received my commission after three months' training at *HMS King Alfred* at Hove. 

I was appointed to Combined Operations as Beachmaster of L2 Commando, a unit of the Royal Naval Commandos. Royal Navy Commando units were denoted by letters from A Commando through to the all-Canadian W Commando. Each such unit was commanded by a Principal Beachmaster with the rank of Lieutenant Commander, and consisted of three sections, each with a Beachmaster, an Assistant Beachmaster, two Petty Officers, a Leading Seaman, and 20 Able Seamen. Much like the captain of a ship, during a landing a Beachmaster had the final word on operations and outranked any officer who crossed his beach.


**Training began two years before the landings**

We started out training at *[HMS Armadillo](http://gallery.commandoveterans.org/cdoGallery/d/19167-9/RN+Commando+HMS+Armadillo_+Glenfinart.jpg)*, a forestry camp near the small Highland village of Ardentinny on Loch Long in Scotland.

The firs part of the training was fitness. We had to be able to march 20 mils a day in full kit. We did this in the mountains around Ardentinny, sometimes bivouacking overnight. 

After several weeks we started beach training with the small number of landing craft available at the time. We then started small scale exercises with the Canadian Regiment that would ultimately be our assault troops on our beach on D Day.

At the end of December we moved to Castle Toward in Scotland, known in the Navy as [*HMS Brontosaurus*](http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y235/Section1/swiki/c1/castoward01.jpg). I don't remember the castle as we were based in Nissan huts in the grounds. It was a Combined Operations establishment, and the Canadian troops were there also.

After a short stay, L Commando was relocated to the Isle of Bute where the officers were accommodated in a luxury hotel to our surprise, and to the surprise of the residents! We were stationed there for one week to conduct some small exercises.

In early January 1943 we left in landing craft and embarked in *HMS Glengyle*, LSI(L) [Landing Ship Infantry (Large)], a small liner carrying its own landing craft, and sailed for the Kyles of Lochalsh for more exercises.  The object of these exercises was to find out if it was feasible to land at night with part of the beach lit by searchlight. We landed from our landing craft up to our waists in icy water each night at midnight, watched by a number of admirals and generals. After each night we marched back to our ship to sleep. After twenty nights it was decided that it would not be a success!

In May we transferred to *HMS Vectis*, a landing craft base and HQ of Force J, at Cowes on the Isle of Wight and became part of Force J1 under [Captain Anthony Puglsey, RN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Follett_Pugsley). We carried out small landing exercises around Cowes as well as spending short periods with various sections of the Army and Air Force to learn what equipment would be coming ashore. 

We undertook a range of additional activities to assist our overall training. First a week at Achnacarry, the Commando training base in the Scottish Highlands near Fort William, where a special commando course had been arranged for us! 

Second we went for a week to Blandford in Dorset near Poole, the base of the Army Tank Corps, to learn the types of vehicles that would be landing with the tanks. 

Third we went to the RAF Regiment base in the north of England, location unknown, again to learn the types of vehicles and equipment that would come ashore for the construction of airstrips. Exact dates of these visits I do not remember.

In July we moved to [*HMS Mastodon*](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/66516000/jpg/_66516068_66516066.jpg), Edward Rothschild's house at Exbury, where I was accommodated in the grand house. We were free to go anywhere in the magnificent gardens, but not in the orchid house! The front steps and portico were a favourite spot for informal gatherings of officers and for taking photos. 

We then started large scale exercises lasting up to a week at either Bracklesham Bay or Studland Bay, both with similar beaches to Normandy. We lived in dugouts at the back of the beach, a basic way of life we would get used to. The exercises were watched by many senior officers and changes to the procedures were made.

In October it was decided our discipline needed improving, so we were sent to Whale Island (the RN Gunnery School) off Portsmouth. I was accommodated in the *Royal Yacht Victoria &amp; Albert* which had been decommissioned in 1939 after accommodating royal families at sea for 40 years. Needless to say it was very comfortable and luxurious, but we were so tired that we were in bed by eight o'clock every night!

On the first morning there I was called to the Captain because I had stopped a flotilla of landing craft from beaching because of beach obstacles and the risk of a high tide damaging their ramps. Fortunately he agreed with my decision and sent the despatch rider back with the message, otherwise I would almost certainly have faced disciplinary proceedings!

At Christmas 1943 we returned to *HMS Armadillo* in Scotland for two weeks' refresher training, after which we returned to *HMS Mastodon* and continued to do extensive exercises. 

**Fred meets a Navy Wren**

In November 1943 someone came into the bar and told me there was a WRNS (Women's Royal Naval Service) officer having dinner, so I thought I had better check up. [*I've left the next bit out as it's a bit personal for sharing on the internet, but suffice to say it wasn't long before they were engaged*].

Dorothy was based in Lepe House, the headquarters for Force J under Captain Pugsley. My first visit to [Lepe House](http://www.photos.sailingvoyage.com/d/6302-2/IMG_2488.JPG) was in February 1944 to a grand party held by Captain Pugsley to which he invited all the senior personnel from the three services who were going to be involved in D-Day later in 1944. I have always regarded it as as great honour to have been invited as I would have been the most junior officer there by far. I assume I was invited as Dorothy's fiance, as Dorothy was one of his two cipher officers.

In March 1944 we moved to Pines Camp, a section of *HMS Vectis* and a short distance outside Cowes. The Commander looked after Dorothy like a daughter when she came over to the Wardroom. She was able to stay at the Wren officers quarters whenever she was able to come from Lepe House. During this period there was an hourly boat service between Lepe and Cowes. 

At the end of March it was becoming increasingly obvious that the invasion of France was not far off (Dorothy as Pugsley's cipher officer was well-informed but was of course not able to communicate anything to me) so we decided to get married in April. [*note: Dorothy was handling signals that were predicting up to 90% casualties for the first few waves ashore in Normandy. She knew Fred would be one of the first onto the beach and thought it almost a certainty that he would be killed - but due to the classified nature of the information, she was unable to tell him anything.*]

My senior officer Commander Redvers Prior, RN was also based at Lepe House, so my second visit was in early April 1944 to ask Commander Prior for leave for a short honeymoon after our proposed wedding. He was very generous, granting me ten days providing we stayed on the Isle of Wight and he knew how I could be contacted if I was needed for an urgent briefing. [*I've left out the rest about their wedding and honeymoon*].

**D-Day begins**

In May we were taken to our allotted position in the New Forest ready for embarkation for D Day. All units were in groups for our ships or landing craft. We spent much of the time being briefed on the landing and were given a pictorial map of where we would land. Our beach sector was on Juno Beach, and L Commando was to control the beach area to the east of Courseulles.

Dorothy had a little story to tell of how, when she went for a bicycle ride through the Forest with the roads lined with equipment and troops, she realised how tense it was as there were no wolf whistles!

Our task was to support the Canadian troops landing on Juno beach by ensuring that their supplies of petrol, ammunition and compo packs were maintained as they advanced.

Eventually on 5th June we loaded onto lorries and went off to our ship the *Royal Ulsterman*, an ex-Irish ferry classed as a landing ship infantry because it carried its own landing craft. The crossing was quite rough and we sympathised with troops in small craft. All night long we could hear the airborne troops going overhead. 

At dawn the warships opened fire and the shells overhead sounded like express trains. We embarked in our landing craft and headed for the shore. Underwater clearance teams and the amphibious tanks went ahead of us. The first Canadian troops ashore encountered strong opposition at the back of the beach and suffered heavy casualties, but they succeeded in putting all the strong points, gun emplacements, and pillboxes out of action. Our actual landing on the beach a few minutes after the first wave was not too badly opposed. 

We [set about organising](http://media-1.web.britannica.com/eb-media/18/47918-004-F57A34B1.jpg) the landing craft and directing tanks, vehicles and troops off the beach and through the beach exits. We also ordered landing craft to leave as soon as they unloaded, so as to avoid broaching to in the strong wind and to avoid congestion on beach space. All Naval Beach Parties were in khaki uniforms as in blue we would have been too conspicuous for snipers.

The army provided bulldozers to help reflect any stranded landing craft and special maintenance vehicles to deal with any breakdown on the beach. The bulldozers were also used to pull German beach obstacles out of the way. The scene could probably best be described as [organised chaos](http://www.dday-overlord.com/img/dday/jb/juno_beach_debarquement_chars.jpg)! it was just as well that we did not have to contend with enemy aircraft.

At the end of the day we all went into trenches, well dug by the Germans, near St Berniere to face inland in preparation for a counter attack which fortunately did not come, and at dawn we returned to our own beach.

**After D-Day**

We prepared dugouts in shallow dunes below a railway line running along the back of the beach, with sandbags and beach debris for a roof. My Assistant Beachmaster and I shared a dugout. We found some tins of rice pudding which we stored in the sand under us. We worked four hours on and four off while we were there.

On D+1 we noticed a line of old merchant ships forming an arc to the west of us which were in due course sunk. These were to provide protection for the assembling of the harbour. During the next few days the caissons we had seen being built near Lepe House and later floating in the Solent started to form what was to be [Mulberry Harbour](http://www.war44.com/misc/images/5/WWII_Mulberry_harbour.jpg).

Over the next few weeks we continued to support the Canadians with their essentials, evacuating the wounded and prisoners of war, removing the beach obstructions, repairing damaged landing craft and keeping the beach clear for incoming vehicles.

*Okay, I'll leave it at that.  After D-Day he was involved in the liberation of Westkapelle, and witnessed the Japanese surrender. His wife, Dorothy, had an even more interesting story to tell because she was stationed at Fort Southwark handling all the signals for the D-Day invasion, but sadly she died a few years ago without having written her memoirs.*

**Edit: A couple of other details I should have included originally: Fred's Commando suffered only one casualty during the landings at Normandy - an Assistant Signalman who was killed on D+1 when a mortar landed on him. Fred himself was highly decorated during the war but he's so modest that I don't even know exactly which medals he received. I will find out one day.**

46,Tower of London - 1480s - Daily life,"Hello r/history!
So I am doing a little bit of research into various topics regarding the events of the Wars of the Roses. Now, a particular event caught my eye, and that is the imprisonment of Edward V of England and Richard of Shrewsbury (more commonly known as the Princes in the Tower).

Since I am researching this in order to write a story for a video game, I want my base to be as historically accurate as possible. A lot of subtle detail and info that is absolutely mandatory for me is really hard to find online.

So here are my questions:

- Can someone describe life in the Tower of London during that time (1480-1485)? 
- How did it function - What was the hierarchy that governed its daily functions? 
- What types of servants worked inside the tower? What were their duties and daily tasks (essential staff).
- Since from what I see, the tower was used as a prison as well - what did the life of the prisoners look like? I'm particularly interested in the day to day activities.
- What did the boys life inside look like? Same as above, day to day activities.

Sorry if some of these questions seem silly, I am still in the middle of collecting information on all of the events etc, and some specifics are hard to get a hold of. 

Any links or information that can help me with any of these questions will be greatly appreciated!

Thank you for your time!

""In one of the most widely-debated decisions of the war, the Germans halted their advance on Dunkirk. Contrary to popular belief, what became known as ""the Halt Order"" did not originate with Adolf Hitler. Gerd von Rundstedt and Günther von Kluge suggested that the German forces around the Dunkirk pocket should cease their advance on the port and consolidate, to avoid an Allied break.

Hitler sanctioned the order on 24 May with the support of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW). The army was to halt for three days, giving the Allies time to organise the Dunkirk evacuation and build a defensive line.

Despite the Allies' gloomy estimates of the situation, with Britain discussing a conditional surrender to Germany, in the end over 330,000 Allied troops were rescued.""

This browsing option turns Hungaricana into a user-friendly, but highly effective and professional portal. The search engine allows the user to browse simultaneously among all the databases, consequently it is time efficient, moreover it lists all the relevant results, maybe even those ones that were previously unremarked by the user.

**Old Hungarian Library** - The Old Hungarian Library is the merit of Károly Szabó (1824-1890), who collected and unfolded with scientifical accuracy the proofs of Hungarian literacy from the very beginning until the [Treaty of Szatmár](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Szatm%C3%A1r). Károly Szabó’s book is a collection of titles, that reveal the works written in Hungarian and published in the country. The Arcanum did not only digitize the above mentioned book, but also the original printed holdings (600 volumes coming from the National Széchenyi Library), altogether 200.000 pages.

I have been bouncing through this subs recommended reading for a while, but I wanted to ask what people think are the very best ones for someone new to history.

For example, many people suggested Runciman's history of the Crusades as one of the best books on the subject, but I found reading it to be a bit of a drag.  I am not yet at that level of reading.

41,What are some history books that you feel everyone in your country should read?,"I'm from the US, and I feel that I never had a great understanding of many important events in the history of my own country. I like to read a lot on my own, and I've come across a few books that I think every American should read. I'm also always interested in the histories of other countries. What are some books that you feel everyone in your country should read? Here are three of my choices:

1) I Will Fight No More Forever- Merrill Beal
The American Indian Wars are undoubtedly one of the darkest parts of our history, and I feel that it is because of this that so many US history classes gloss over it. This book gives an outstanding background of the events leading up to the Nez Perce War, and did a great job of making you understand why the different groups made the decisions they did and how the tragic misunderstanding between the army and the Nimíipuu (the Nez Perce's word for themselves). I started reading this book when I was riding a bike through the area, as I had read a lot about the battles on roadside information boards and wanted to know more. I also visited a few museums dedicated the war, and the one thing the book does far better is explain why the whites were so belligerent. While I can't at all agree with them (in my comfortable 21st century retrospect), I can definitely understand them, something I was unable to do based on the information I picked up at the museums. The Nez Perce War was one of the saddest wars in our history, especially because it amounted to a completely pointless slaughter of a tribe that was nothing but friendly to the US since they sheltered Lewis and Clark during the Corps of Discovery Expedition. 

2) The Good War- Studs Terkel (Pullitzer Prize 1985)
When I was quite young I read a lot about World War II, and thought I knew almost everything about it. I could talk about the precursors, the important battles, and different weapons, you name it. Then I heard about this book from Max Brooks, the author of World War Z. I had really enjoyed the narrative style of that book, and when I found out that he had copied the format from this non-fiction ""oral history"" of World War II, I went out and bought it the next day. It completely changed the way I look at the war, the atom bomb, the Manhattan Project, the Cold War, and what it even means to be an American in the postwar period. Terkel composed this book from hundreds if not thousands of interviews with various people (although overwhelmingly American) to tell us not merely what happened but what it felt like to be alive when it did. We see what it was like to live in the small towns or work in the ship yards, or even in Los Alamos working on the bomb. This last topic is also remarkably well done, and as a physicist, my respect level for these men has increased tenfold. Did you know that the physicists wanted to invite a delegation from Japan to witness the first test at the Trinity site so that the use of the bomb on a real city could be avoided? Did you know that the only reason the second bomb was dropped was to scare the Russians into thinking we had so many of them that we could throw them away like candy? World War II was a huge event for the entire world, but especially so for America as it was the catalyst for our rise into the modern era, and every one of us should know something about that catalyst, be it an eye watering account of bravery and good will or a soul crushing description of our wanton destruction of human life. 

3) This Kind of War- T. R. Fehrenbach 
The so-called classic history of the Korean War, this is another book that I feel all Americans should read as it describes one of the most important events in the opening stages of the Cold War, came to define many of the things we associate with that period, and is a remarkably important landmark in our relations with China and to a lesser extent the Soviet Union. That all I recall from history class was something about the word ""containment"" is a travesty, and this book shows in both an entertaining an informative way what the Korean War was all about. The Korean War is also referred to as ""The Forgotten War,"" and that is something for which we should all be ashamed.",history,1430605031,ineedagoldenaxe,511,725,True,2015-05-02

25,The ancient Greeks really loved fish!,"Just finished reading a book called ""Courtesans and Fishcakes: The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens"" by James Davidson. He talks about the Athenians was big connoisseurs of fish, and has a text from a play called ""Soldier"" by a comic playwright Philemon. In this play the chef talks about a fish recipe he made:


""For a yearning stole up on me to go forth and tell the world, and not only the world but the heavens too, how I prepared the dish--By Athena, how sweet it is to get it right every time--What a fish it was I had tender before me! 
What a dish I made of it! Not drugged senseless with cheeses, nor window-boxed with dandifying herbs, it emerged from the oven as naked as the day it was born. So tender, so soft was the fire I invested in the cooking of it. You wouldn't believe the result. 

It was just like when a chicken gets hold of something bigger than she can swallow and runs around in a circle, unable to let it our of her sight, determined to get it down, while the other chickens chase after her. 

It was just the same: the first man among them to discover the delights of the dish leapt up and fled taking the platter with him for a lap of the circuit, the others hot on his heels. I allowed myself a shriek of joy, as some snatched at something, some snatched at everything and others snatched at nothing at all.

And yet I had merely taken into my care some mud-eating river-fish. If I had got hold of something more exceptional, a 'little grey' from Attica, say, or a boar-fish from Argos, or from dear old Sicyon the fish that Poseidon carries to the gods in heaven, a conger-eel, then everyone would have attained to a state of divinity.

91,TL;DR of human history.,"I am trying to create a sort of executive summary of human history, and I would appreciate help from people who are much smarter and more knowledgeable than myself.  I put together a little something below to show what I have in mind.  It is admittedly very Eurocentric due to me being a product of the American public school system, and leaves out lots of important stuff in China, India, and other places I'm sure.  But it shows what I'm aiming for at least - something around a thousand words or less that gives an overview of the entirety of human history, from our emergence as a unique species to modern day.  Any input is appreciated:


Modern humans evolved in Africa.  About 200,000 years ago early humans started to migrate out of Africa on foot.  Lower sea levels, caused by the Ice Age, allowed them to reach North and South America, the Asian Pacific Islands, and Australia, by crossing land bridges that are now covered by ocean water.  Over time they came to populate the entire globe.  For tens of thousands of years they lived a hunter-gatherer, nomadic lifestyle.  In the long arc of our history it is really not until relatively recently - about 5000 years ago - that humans began to eschew this lifestyle in favor of one that paved the way for modernity - farming and the domestication of animals.  As humans began to turn to agriculture, the earliest civilizations sprung up around several important rivers, which offered everything that primitive humans needed to adopt an agricultural lifestyle - fertile farm land and a reliable source of drinking water.  The Tigris and Euphrates saw the emergence of early Mesopotamian civilizations and the Nile saw the emergence of the ancient Egyptian civilization.  The various civilizations and empires of the modern day middle east grew in size and strength, warring with each other over the course of several centuries.  The Persian Empire eventually grew to be the strongest of this ancient era, until they were defeated by Alexander the Great of modern day Greece.  This ushered in the classical age, which saw the rise to prominence of European civilizations, culminating in the unprecedented dominance of the Roman Empire.  The fall of the Roman Empire led to the middle ages.  Once unified under the Romans, Europe splintered into a patchwork of kingdoms characterized by a feudal lifestyle and monarchical system of government.  This period also saw the rise of the Islamic caliphates to the east and the resultant holy wars between east and west.  A new age of enlightenment began in Italy and spread through Europe, bringing a renewed sense of forward progress to western culture.  During this time bold explorers struck out across the ocean and discovered the Americas.  There they encountered people who still mostly adhered to a hunter-gatherer nomadic lifestyle.  Due to technological superiority born of many centuries of progress that the Europeans enjoyed and to which the Native Americans were not privy, the Europeans were able to conquer and colonize the Americas with relative ease.  The world as we know it today began to take shape.  The Industrial Revolution swept through Europe and the United States, setting the stage for the two world wars.  After World War II the United States emerged as the dominant superpower on the world stage.  A second, informational revolution saw the emergence of the world wide web, which offered to connect all of humanity in a way never before imaginable.  And that brings us to present day.",history,1429484512,apatheticnihilist,27,23,True,2015-04-19

-How accurate was the depiction of he viking attacker and parisian defender, Did the average viking assault it with just shield and axe often shirtless?


-The primary and effective weapon of the defenders was the crossbow, historically was this how Paris and other french cities defended themselves? regiments of crossbow armed soldiers?


-The siege technique used to bring down the gate (metal hooks pulled by horses and men) after the ram had failed was the first time Ive seen this depiction, was that an actually siege technique and how effective was it?


-Was there a holy banner present during the first siege of paris and how often are holy ""relics"" used in battles?


-During the assault on the 2nd gate when they crossed the bridge, a powerful ""ballista"" like weapon fired multiple bolts into the Vikings, what was this weapon and is this how the bridge of Paris would have been defended?



-Would the wealth and loot inside the city of Paris (or any walled city) be worth the hundreds of Casualities and resources spent by the Vikings?



-There are many more interesting things going on in this amazing depiction of the battle of Paris, any viewer please feel free to ask your own questions.

EDIT (4-12-15) It's morning here now and I am uploading the second bunch.  70 more pages.  Based on my experience last night, it should take a couple of hours to complete.  Watch this space...  Done!

-How exactly did the vikings assault the walled island city of paris? did they have floating ladder towers like in the episode?


-How accurate was the depiction of he viking attacker and parisian defender, Did the average viking assault it with just shield and axe often shirtless?


-The primary and effective weapon of the defenders was the crossbow, historically was this how Paris and other french cities defended themselves? regiments of crossbow armed soldiers?


-The siege technique used to bring down the gate (metal hooks pulled by horses and men) after the ram had failed was the first time Ive seen this depiction, was that an actually siege technique and how effective was it?


-Was there a holy banner present during the first siege of paris and how often are holy ""relics"" used in battles?


-During the assault on the 2nd gate when they crossed the bridge, a powerful ""ballista"" like weapon fired multiple bolts into the Vikings, what was this weapon and is this how the bridge of Paris would have been defended?



-Would the wealth and loot inside the city of Paris (or any walled city) be worth the hundreds of Casualities and resources spent by the Vikings?

Private Bernard Roth Tells Of Escape From Nazi Prison

It will be remembered that Pvt. Bernard Roth, son of Mr. And Mrs. Ford Roth, McGrath, was reported “missing in action” in early fall of last year. After an anxious period of long waiting a letter came from Bernard from a German prison camp, which relieved the family’s anxiety somewhat. Then report came that the camp had been liberated by the Russians and he was awaiting transportation. Last week this letter was received by his parents:

    “The first thing I will tell is why I haven’t written before. As I told you before I was up front quite a bit of the time and we had just gone through the Siegfried line and stopped in the Aire, on the other side. We got a small counter attack and the first thing I knew I was in ‘Jerry’s’ hands with three other Yanks. Things weren’t so good. I didn’t have any too much to eat, nothing to smoke. One of the boys that was wounded with me died.

    Then we got a few more men in who needed a lot of medical care and supplies. Jerry wouldn’t give them to us and all the tools we had was a saw and a knife and don’t think they didn’t use it. Many boys needed blood. I gave three times in five weeks and on cabbage soup you can’t build it back up. Maybe I could if I had enough. That’s why I began to show the wear. Well then a few more Yanks came in and things got a little better and I snapped out of it, in fact I got to feeling quite cocky and up to where I weighed 175 or so.

    Then one day after the snow had gone, one of the boys came down with diphtheria and he was wounded bad. I knew as all the boys did that he was soon to cash in his chips, but until then he had to be isolated so he would need a medic. Well everything went okay for about a week and in came three more, but they didn’t have that, they had black plague and rose fever and at this time I wished I was a WAC. Two of them cashed in their chips and the other two got well. In comes 20 more men, four with diphtheria and the others exposed to it.

    By this time on good clear nights we could hear the fog rolling in with a little steel mixed with it. The Yanks were coming. Well I had had a long time to think about it and I had just about made up my mind when a Jerry did it for me. He asked me to take all the names of the men who could walk. The next day or so we would all be moved back 150 kilometers into Dutch land. A few days before I had been talking to the other boys who would like to “fly the coop”. One was from Minnesota.

                                                  * * *

    On the night of the 6th of March at about seven o’clock we had an air raid (just planes going over) and so the boys on the towers on the corners came down and went into the air raid shelters. Well I quickly summed up the score, stay here and starve or get damn hungry and be walked back 150 kilometers. The war didn’t look to me to last over two months more but still 25 miles away was plenty to eat and a good hospital, so why not take a chance. I got the other two boys and we went to the fence and kicked a hole in it a foot and a half square, jumped through, jumped over the barbed wire in the middle to the other fence and kicked through that one and jumped through.

    Right behind me was the other fellow from Minnesota. We turned to see and looked for the other one but he just said ‘good luck boys’ and turned away. There were only two of us and we took off, no maps, no compass, but the farmers had set old barns on fire maybe 20 or 30 miles away and we could see quite plain. We kept it over our shoulder and took for the tall timber, which I was told went all the way to the river, maybe 15 kilometers (11 miles). Those P. W. camps have some good dogs they say. Did we make tracks. The first thing we knew we were right in the middle of a big airport. We couldn’t go back now so on we went and we made it through.

                                                  * * *

    The next thing we ran into was a big ‘dump’, gas or ammunition I didn’t know which, but plenty guards around. We fixed them with a few old tricks we had learned from trapping beaver. Only thing though beaver are a darn sight smarter. We got by them. Around 3:30 a.m. we came to the river. She is a wide drink and darn cold. How are we to cross, for she had guards walking her banks.

                                                  * * *

    We remembered a hay stack about a half mile back and we went back, got a hole in the middle of it and jumped in. It’s hard to stay still all day, anyway when its cold and wet from walking in a ditch of water to ditch the dogs. When it got daylight we saw we were in a big field. No one would come around and we wouldn’t get anything to eat or drink. That afternoon we were laying out a little more in the sun when we noticed a big field of frozen cabbage. One of the heads would be good to chew on so I got one.

    On my way back two farmers watched me and I am dressed in full Yank uniform, but no helmet. I hadn’t any more than hit the hay when the old devil came nosing around. He knew something was up so in an hour he sent his two kids to watch the stack and we never notice them till they had seen us. We both made faces at them and they took off. They were about 8 or 9 years old. When they went we took the other way and hid in some brush about a foot and half high. It soon got dark and we started out.

    When we got to the river, I don’t know but I think the hay stack was afire. We walked along the river ducking the guards and looking for a boat, but no boat. Soon we were in a town and we were meeting German soldiers on the street. We still walked on, hoping no one would stop us and no one did. We walked ten miles that way up the east side of the Rhine, then we crossed.

                                                  * * *

    I am now in a hospital back in France. I will be out in maybe two or three weeks. I feel good though and there is nothing the matter with me. Just a check-up.”

When he was drafted he was asked if he liked to hunt. He answered no, that he would only hunt to get food for his family. Because of this they labeled him a conscientious objector and made him a medic.

He was a Mason. When he was in the POW camp one of the German guards helped him because he was also a Mason. The guard gave him an egg (or eggs) to eat. Possibly the part in the letter when he “got a little better and I snapped out of it”.

The guard also told him that the guards were going to leave their posts during the next air raid and go into the shelter.


I heard he was interviewed by Kate Smith. I could not find any recordings from the war.

Stalag 6g was near Bonn Germany, but I can’t find the exact location.

Here is a photo of him.

This got me thinking, what other points in history, if small variables changed, could have played out differently? What would have been the implications? Another example of mine is if the soviet central committee had been more astute they could have seen the implications of having such potential power in the role of general secretary.

36,"Epitaph on the headstone of John Jack, an African-American who bought his freedom after being sold into slavery","[A piece of history, the headstone of John Jack](http://i.imgur.com/aTH5gln.jpg?1)

The headstone reads:

&gt; God wills us free, man wills us slaves.
&gt; I will as God wills Gods will be done. 
&gt; Here lies the body of John Jack,
&gt; A native of Africa who died 
&gt; March 1773, aged about 60 years. 
&gt; Tho born in a land of slavery, 
&gt; He was born free. 
&gt; Tho he lived in a land of liberty, 
&gt; He lived as a slave, 
&gt; Till by his honest, tho stolen labors, 
&gt; He acquired the source of slavery. 
&gt; Which gave him his freedom, 
&gt; Tho not long before,
&gt; Death the grand tyrant, 
&gt; Gave him his final emancipation, 
&gt; And set him on a footing with kings. 
&gt; Tho a slave to vice, 
&gt; He practised those virtues, 
&gt; Without which kings are but slaves.

The town of Concord, Massachusetts is rich in literary history; the words of Hawthorne, Alcott, Thoreau and Emerson have echoed through time.

But it may very well be that the most powerful words to come from this small town are written on a largely forgotten headstone in the back of the Old Hill Burying Ground.

86,Tommy the Tenderfoot: Drawings and Rhymes to help new Boy Scouts (1918),"[Imgur link to collection of pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/NOsCZ)

I'm currently working on a thesis project about the role Boy Scouting had in Colonial Africa, more specifically how Scouting is inherently incompatible with colonialism. 

Of course, Lord Baden-Powell's (The founder of Scouts) writings are hugely helpful in looking at the philosophy behind Scouting. So, to get a handle on that philosophy I am reading through one of the later editions of Scouting for Boys (1951). It mostly retains Baden-Powell's writings unchanged, with two additional chapters written by then Chief Scout, Lord Rowallan. 

There are only so few chapters dedicated to explaining the Scout Oath, Law, Slogan, and the theory behind those things. Most of the book is dedicated to what you typically imagine Boy Scouts doing: tying knots, setting up tents, first aid, orienteering, etc. Interspersed throughout the book are these 10 vignettes starring Tommy the Tenderfoot. He is a personification of all the mistakes new Scouts make and for whatever reason I found these really humorous. 

My particular favorites in no particular order are 2, 8, 9 and 10. The rhymes are on point and to a modern eye, the pictures are just a tad silly. 

I accessed the copy using a Boy Scout Resource website called, ""The Dump"" (A fitting name for a Boy Scout site of this nature). You can find the 1951 edition [here.](http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/s4b.html) The full text is the last link on the right. 

Hope you guys enjoy this and if you have any questions regarding the history of Boy Scouts, I'm happy to answer them!

Easter is celebrated the world over to mark the resurrection of Jesus Christ – the Son of God. The young and the old, the rich and the poor, man and woman and people of all races celebrate Easter. However, Easter has been commercialized to a large extent by companies manufacturing Easter related goods and items and the greeting card industry.

48,What are some interesting centuries? Is history just a long series a centuries?,"So we often casually refer to events by their century as a rough timeline context. Recently I got on a jag thinking about globally significant ""Centuries"" in ***World*** History. Here were the first six that popped into my head:

~~~

**The Short Twentieth: 1914 - 1991.** The mass society and efficiency of industrialization and automation leads to a century marked by global conflict. Colonialism and the first world world war marks the first half with the cold war and global conflict centered on bi-polar ideology marks the second half with the mass-murder of the second world war as it’s central pivot. 

**The Long Nineteenth: 1789 - 1914.** Political turmoil as the nascent industrial revolution and associated technological revolutions spurs a shift from Imperial political structures to nationalist structures across the globe. 

**The English Century: 1660 - 1815.** Bookended by the English Restoration and the battle of Waterloo, global events are remarkable for the consistency of the trend of growing English power and influence. From fractured island Kingdom known for its textile and shipping industries that barely survived an Armada the previous century, England would end this century the closest thing the world has seen to a hegemony. 

**The Mongol Empire: 1206-1294.** Inland Eurasia briefly undergoes a collective experience of invasion followed by relative freedom of trade and intellectual exchange. 

**The Imperial Period of Islam: 610 - 750** In 610 Muhammad was visited by the angel Gabriel. In 622 he returned to Mecca with 10,000 converts. Little over a hundred years later the Umayyad Caliphate marked the the political ascendancy of Muslim rulers. While the Abbasid/Islamic Golden Age, followed by the Ottoman conquests are more familiar to most Western historians (for their effect on the preservation of classical Hellenic texts and effect on medieval European politics respectively) the turmoil and successions of the seventh century was the foundation that would allow for the conversions of the following millennium.  Also, the Imperial period more closely follows the pattern of a century being a critical demarcation of time compared to the 400 year Islamic golden age.  

**The Fifth Century BCE and the Thousand Schools of Thought:** The Athens Ascendency of the eastern Mediterranean, the Waring States Period in China, the rise of Buddhism. If you took an introductory humanities class in college, it doesn’t matter if it concerns religion, literature, philosophy, asian traditions or classical thought, the first page of the syllabus probably is dominated by someone active in the fifth century BCE.  

~~~

So, in conclusion, after these examples...

**So, what are some other centuries of global significance?^1**

**Secondly, could we divide all of recent history into centuries with flashy memorable names?^2**

1) Rules of the game: (I) there has to be some global cohesion to the designation, i.e. involve events on more than one continent. (II) The time period should be close to 100 years, and for bonus points should roughly correspond to a numbered century. The imperial period of Islam suffers slightly under this criteria as it extends halfway into the seventh century.

2) The question is ""*could* we,"" not ""*should* we."" Sure, there wouldn't be much gained from such an exercise. But as my favorite professors would never say: history shouldn't be relevant or critical reviewed for analytical rigor, it should be fun!

Text of the article is as follows: 

&gt; MCCARTHY GOES BEFORE LOYALTY PROBE MEMBERS - President on Air to Deny Commies Invade State Department
&gt; 
&gt; April 24, 1950
&gt; 
&gt; Washington -- (INS) -- Senator Joseph McCarthy (R) of Wisconsin goes before the senate loyalty committee today to demand a thorough probe of his charges of communism in the state department. 
&gt; 
&gt; This development came after McCarthy charged that Secretary of State Dean Acheson is following the ""Truman-Tydings-McMahon line"" in attacking the persons seeking to uncover Reds in government work. 
&gt; 
&gt; President Truman will go on the air tonight to deny flatly that the administration has failed to stop communist invasion of the state department. 
&gt; 
&gt; A White House aide said that the president would name no names but would give a direct reply to the communist infiltration charge. 
&gt; 
&gt; Acheson denounced McCarthy's charges over the week-end as ""mad"" and ""vicious,"" and asserted that the campaign against the department is ""without sense, without purpose and without direction."" 
&gt; 
&gt; The secretary did not mention McCarthy by name. 
&gt; 
&gt; McCarthy, however, quickly retorted that he was both ""disappointed and disturbed"" by Acheson's remarks, and added:
&gt; 
&gt; ""It indicates that the head of the state department goes along 100 per cent with the Tydings, McMahon, Truman idea that a real criminal is the man trying to expose communists and perverts in government and not the communists who are trying to betray this nation.""
&gt; 
&gt; McCarthy goes into executive session with the subcommittee headed by Senator Tydings (D) of Maryland, this morning. Ex-communist Louis Bundez, meanwhile, prepared to make his appearance behind the group's closed doors tomorrow morning.

1,American Women In Japan During the Occupation?,"Hi everyone,

Well, as the title suggests, I'm trying to find out if there were any American women who stayed/lived in Japan during the American Occupation after WWII. I know that during WWII, many women served in the army as nurses and so on, but after that, were any of them stationed in Japan? Did any of the soldiers stationed in Japan live on the army base with their families like they do now, or is that only a recent thing? If any women were stationed in Japan during this time, what jobs could they (if any) have while there? Would it have been strictly military members and their families that would have lived in Japan during that time frame, or could civilians move/live there as well?

While I discovered quite a bit about the subject of the American Occupation, this is the one thing I haven't been able to find any information on. So if anyone knows anything at all about this, please let me know.

This is all research for a personal project I'm working on, so it's not homework or anything like that. Just a quick fyi there.

92,First East and South Asian Immigrants to Australia (by country),"Pretext: Being a big history fan, I decided to dig into the history of immigration in Australia. One of the interests that I had was the year of first migration to Australia by country. My search was largely limited to East and South Asian countries due to the limits in my knowledge (sorry).

The data was pulled from six sources: Wikipedia (of course), [Museum Victoria website](http://museumvictoria.com.au/origins/), [ABS census](http://abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/ViewContent?readform&amp;view=ProductsbyCatalogue&amp;Action=Expand&amp;Num=2.2), *The Australian People* (ISBN: 0521807891), [Nature article](http://www.nature.com/news/genomes-link-aboriginal-australians-to-indians-1.12219) and [National Archives of Australia](http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NameSearch/Interface/NameSearchForm.aspx).
 
 
To put things into perspective, British penal colonies were first established in 1788, and first ""free"" immigration occurred in 1815.

India: ~2000 BCE. Yes, that old (Nature article). Tamils were somewhat of Phoenicians of South Asia, and would go seafaring everywhere. Words are that they even reached New Zealand at one point. But more “recently”, Indians from other regions came to Australia as bondservants with the founding of penal colonies. First ""free"" immigration from India was in 1816.

Pakistan: Likely the same with Indians. The 1860s saw camel riders brought into Australia, some from Peshawar. Baluchis appear in the 1901 census.

Afghanistan: 1838 (Wikipedia). The 1860s saw camel riders brought into Australia, and many were Afghans.

Bangladesh: They started being tracked in 1976 with the independence of the country.

Sri Lanka: Maybe some of the Tamils were from Sri Lanka. Apart from that, 1871 census (Victoria) counts “Ceylons”.

No specific data exists with regard to Nepal and Bhutan.

China: 1818 (Mak Sai Ying). A lot of Chinese lived in Australia by the 1840s. By the 1860s, there were so many Chinese that policies directed against the Chinese were established throughout Australia.

Japan: 1873 (Dicinoski). This person was part of a circus troupe. My guess is that ""Dicinoski"" was his stage name, and that his Japanese “name” is Daichi-no-tsuki, literally “the punch/thrust of Daichi”. There are still people bearing that name in Australia.

Korea: 1863? (Nam Peng Cheong). Nam is a surname almost exclusive to Korea. My guess is that his name in the modern form will be Nam Pyeong Cheon or something in that line. There were definitely quite a few Koreans by 1881, when other likely-Korean surnames (Ahn, Kim) start appearing in the national archive.

Tibet: 1973 (Namygel Tsering). Tibet as a nation does not exist, but it was included out of curiosity.

No specific data exists with regard to Mongolia and Uighur. Data for Taiwan was excluded because whatever the number I put up will be incorrect.

Vietnam: 1883? (Le Tung). I bet a reddit karma that it started earlier, though.

Cambodia: 1950s (students, some of whom likely got stranded in the 1970s due to the communist revolution).

Laos: 1976 for Laotians. However, a Laotian Hmong, Lee Yia, came to Australia for studies under the Colombo Plan in 1965, and eventually settled here. He is a well-known scholar.

Thailand: 1900? There were three Thais in Victoria in the 1901 census.

Malaysia: 19th century. Malays are said to have worked as sugar cane labourers. There were 149 Malays in 1871 census.

Indonesia: Time immemorial. They constantly mingled with the Australian Indigenous due to the proximity. Otherwise, the 1870s.

Philippines: 1872, but probably earlier.

I excluded data for Singapore and Brunei for obvious reasons.

60,Why was Spain virtually uncontested in the Americas for more than a hundred years?,"Spain (and Portugal too, I guess) were very fast to exploit their newly claimed territories in the Americas. By 1500 or so they had colonists on the ground in many places, and by 1550 their imperial possessions in the Americas were integral parts of their economies. The other Western European powers (namely England and France), were much slower to realize that the Americas were there for the taking, and didn't really scramble to challenge Spain's hegemony there until about 1600. 

Sure, there were the expeditions of Giovanni da Verrazzano and John Cabot in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but England and France didn't *really* start putting settlements on the ground on the scale Spain did until the 17th century. 

Why were they not in a place to start settling the Americas around the year 1500 while Spain was? [According to this source, France alone had twice Spain's population at the time.](http://www.worldmapper.org/posters/worldmapper_map8_ver5.pdf)

edit: I originally said Samuel De Champlain instead of Giovanni da Verrazzano. It turns out that I was a little mistaken about the timeframe of their expeditions.

75,"Vlad III, AKA"" Vlad the Impaler"" had a brother named ""Radu, the handsome""...","Vlad III who fought against the Ottoman Empire, was also fighting against his brother ""Radu the Handsome"" who was Muslim. Radu later participated alongside Mehmet II, the Sultan, in the Ottoman siege that led to the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.

In 1436, Vlad III's father, Vlad II Dracul, ascended the throne of Wallachia but was ousted a few years later by a rival faction, nevertheless, Vlad II was able to secure Ottoman support for his return. Doing so he agreed to pay tribute to the Sultan and also send his two sons, Vlad III (Aka Vlad the Impaler) and Radu ""The Handsome"", to the Ottoman court, to serve as hostages of his loyalty to the empire.

Radu became a good friend of the sultan's son, Mehmet II and later converted to Islam. Vlad did not but both were educated in the sciences, logic, the Quran and the Turkish and Persian language, along with literature.
It's ironic that Vlad would later fight his brother in their own land. Vlad's wartime cruelty and horrific stories (both true and exaggerated) later helped inspire writer Dram Stoker who used his Vlad's family name of ""Dracul"" (Dracula) and Vlad III's bloodthirsty tactics for his novel. The connection of the name ""Count Dracula"" has been a recurring character in vampire mythology.

30,Experiment: World War 2 free week from Feb 16 until Feb 23,"Hi /r/history! 

Next week we are going to run a little experiment. We are not allowing submissions with subjects related to World War 2. The reason we are doing this is that since World War 2 and everything related to it is such a popular subject it tends to drown out other subjects. 
This is something we, and a lot of people that messaged us over time, think is a shame. By disallowing subjects related to World War 2 we hope to see a heavier focus on other aspects of history. 

What this effectively means is that a lot of subjects in the period from 1939 to 1945 will be removed, but also some things from earlier periods that directly relate to World War 2. For example, anything related to the rise of the Nazis will also be removed. 

Just to be very clear, this is just an experiment and not a permanent change. The experiment will run from February the 16th until February the 23th.

57,My grandfather caught on film in 1945,"So, throughout my life I never truly knew my family's history. I was told that my Grandfather got his last name upon entering the US as an orphan from a Jewish military member and that it was made up which is why it's only able to be traced back to my immediate family starting with him. One of my uncles was digging around a few years ago and happened upon a boarding list containing my Grandfather's name for a ship, the SS Gripsholm that was bringing in US citizens who were taken as POWs in China after they were released at the end of WW2. A few years later he's digging around old footage of the ship on YouTube when he stumbles upon this video and is shocked to find my Grandfather at 8 years old being interviewed. The details are still a bit fuzzy but from what I have gathered, my great-grandfather was an American soldier who had a relationship overseas resulting in my Grandfather. My Grandfather and his Mom were taken as POWs and she ended up passing away in the prison camp. I believe, my great-grandfather ended up passing away in a hospital before meeting with his son but that part of the story is vague as well. Probably what I find most amazing is my Grandfather went on to complete several degrees with full scholarships, taught some university classes and was one of the lead contributors to laser guidance systems for some certain type of militarized missiles. Him and his wife had 4 sons, 2 of which became attorneys, one a pediatrician and the other a programmer. My father hopes to record his story while he still has a chance but, understandably, it's a sensitive subject for my grandfather. Anyway, I just felt like sharing his story as I found it unique and the video seems like it might be enjoyed here.

66,Mother Shipton,"The year was 1488 and beside the river Nidd in North Yorkshire, was a cave inside which was a 15 year old girl by the name of Agatha Sontheil who was about to give birth. 
Close to the cave was an ancient well with rich limestone waters and supposed mystical powers to turn objects to stone and known as “The Famous Petrifying Well” or “Dropping Well”.

The woman, who came to act as midwife, spoke of a raven croaking at the chimney pot and an overwhelming smell of sulphur and a great crack of thunder as the child was delivered into the world. The baby was born grotesque, misshapen and huge with some people thinking her father had to be the devil.
 
Agatha named her (Janet) Ursula Sontheil, but gave her up when she was two years old and supposedly hid away in a convent for the rest of her life. 

Her childhood was filled with many strange happenings with furniture reportedly moved around the house of its own volition, plates and crockery were said to fly around the room. Many stories were told of her childhood particularly one morning the young baby and her crib were found to be missing from the house. Several villagers came to her home to search for clues to her disappearance, and were attacked by supernatural forces and bitten by imps allegedly in the form of monkeys. Eventually following some of the neighbours being thrown around the room attached to a yolk, Ursula was discovered in her crib hanging in mid-air half way up the chimney.

At the age of 24 Ursula married Toby Shipton, a carpenter but they had a childless marriage. They lived in Knaresborough and she eventually became known as Mother Shipton a woman who helped many people, which kept away the almost inevitable witch accusation.

Mother Shipton exhibited prophetic and psychic abilities right from an early age but many feared her and her mystical powers, which a few attributed to witchcraft, but she always used them to help people. Her prophecies about events to come were always written in the form of poems. 

King Henry VIII of England was on the throne at the time and she predicted his victory over France at Guinegate, on 16th August 1513 at the ""Battle of the Spurs"", together with Maximillian 1st, The Holy Roman Emperor. She further prophesized the Dissolution of the Monasteries which led to the redistribution of the incredible wealth and land held by the monasteries to the emerging middle class and the existing noble families. 

Her power to see into the future made her well known not only in her home town but throughout England. Despite her traumatic birth and hideous appearance she lived a long life and finally died at Clifton Yorkshire in 1561 aged 73 and her legend was passed on orally, although sometimes embellished as is often the case. Since 1641 there have been more than 50 different editions of books about her and her prophecies. 

It is interesting to note that many of her visions came true within her own lifetime and in subsequent centuries. Mother Shipton predicted important historical events many years ahead of their time, the Great Fire of London in 1666, the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 and the advent of modern technology. She even forecast her own death in 1561 and today her prophecies are still proving uncannily accurate. 

For a number of years prior to 1839, a wax effigy of the Yorkshire Sibyl stood in Westminster Abbey, along with those of other noted persons.
As mentioned above she wrote her prophecies like poems. 

You may find it interesting to see some of Mother Shipton prophecies and see what you make of them.

And now a word, in uncouth rhyme
Of what shall be in future time
Then upside down the world shall be
And gold found at the root of tree
All England's sons that plough the land
Shall oft be seen with Book in hand
The poor shall now great wisdom know
Great houses stand in far-flung vale
All covered o'er with snow and hail



A carriage without horse will go
Disaster fill the world with woe.
In London, Primrose Hill shall be
In centre hold a Bishop's See



Around the world men's thoughts will fly
Quick as the twinkling of an eye.
And water shall great wonders do
How strange. And yet it shall come true.



Through towering hills proud men shall ride
No horse or ass move by his side.
Beneath the water, men shall walk
Shall ride, shall sleep, shall even talk.
And in the air men shall be seen
In white and black and even green



A great man then, shall come and go
For prophecy declares it so.



In water, iron, then shall float
As easy as a wooden boat
Gold shall be seen in stream and stone
In land that is yet unknown.



And England shall admit a Jew
You think this strange, but it is true
The Jew that once was held in scorn
Shall of a Christian then be born.



A house of glass shall come to pass
In England. But Alas, alas
A war will follow with the work
Where dwells the Pagan and the Turk



These states will lock in fiercest strife
And seek to take each other’s life.
When North shall thus divide the south
And Eagle build in Lions mouth
Then tax and blood and cruel war
Shall come to every humble door.



Three times shall lovely sunny France
Be led to play a bloody dance
Before the people shall be free
Three tyrant rulers shall she see.



Three rulers in succession be
Each springs from different dynasty.
Then when the fiercest strife is done
England and France shall be as one.



The British olive shall next then twine
In marriage with a German vine.
Men walk beneath and over streams
Fulfilled shall be their wondrous dreams.



For in those wondrous far off days
The women shall adopt a craze
To dress like men, and trousers wear
And to cut off their locks of hair
They'll ride astride with brazen brow
As witches do on broomstick now.



And roaring monsters with man atop
Does seem to eat the verdant crop
And men shall fly as birds do now
And give away the horse and plough.



There'll be a sign for all to see
Be sure that it will certain be.
Then love shall die and marriage cease
And nations wane as babes decrease



And wives shall fondle cats and dogs
And men live much the same as hogs.



In nineteen hundred and twenty six
Build houses light of straw and sticks.
For then shall mighty wars be planned
And fire and sword shall sweep the land.



When pictures seem alive with movements free
When boats like fishes swim beneath the sea,
When men like birds shall scour the sky
Then half the world, deep drenched in blood shall die.



For those who live the century through
In fear and trembling this shall do.
Flee to the mountains and the dens
To bog and forest and wild fens.



For storms will rage and oceans roar
When Gabriel stands on sea and shore
And as he blows his wondrous horn
Old worlds die and new be born.



A fiery dragon will cross the sky
Six times before this earth shall die
Mankind will tremble and frightened be
for the sixth heralds in this prophecy.



For seven days and seven nights
Man will watch this awesome sight.
The tides will rise beyond their ken
To bite away the shores and then
The mountains will begin to roar
And earthquakes split the plain to shore.



And flooding waters, rushing in
Will flood the lands with such a din
That mankind cowers in muddy fen
And snarls about his fellow men.



He bares his teeth and fights and kills
And secrets food in secret hills
And ugly in his fear, he lies
To kill marauders, thieves and spies.



Man flees in terror from the floods
And kills, and rapes and lies in blood
And spilling blood by mankind’s hands
Will stain and bitter many lands



And when the dragon's tail is gone,
Man forgets, and smiles, and carries on
To apply himself - too late, too late
For mankind has earned deserved fate.




His masked smile - his false grandeur,
Will serve the Gods their anger stir.
And they will send the Dragon back
To light the sky - his tail will crack
Upon the earth and rend the earth
And man shall flee, King, Lord, and serf.




But slowly they are routed out
To seek diminishing water spout
And men will die of thirst before
The oceans rise to mount the shore.



And lands will crack and rend anew
You think it strange. It will come true.



And in some far off distant land
Some men - oh such a tiny band
Will have to leave their solid mount
And span the earth, those few to count,
Who survives this (unreadable) and then
Begin the human race again.



But not on land already there
But on ocean beds, stark, dry and bare
Not every soul on Earth will die
As the Dragons tail goes sweeping by.



Not every land on earth will sink
But these will wallow in stench and stink
Of rotting bodies of beast and man
Of vegetation crisped on land.



But the land that rises from the sea
Will be dry and clean and soft and free
Of mankind’s dirt and therefore be
The source of man's new dynasty.



And those that live will ever fear
The dragons tail for many year
But time erases memory
You think it strange. But it will be.



And before the race is built anew
A silver serpent comes to view
And spew out men of like unknown
To mingle with the earth now grown
Cold from its heat and these men can
Enlighten the minds of future man.


To intermingle and show them how
To live and love and thus endow
The children with the second sight.
A natural thing so that they might
Grow graceful, humble and when they do
The Golden Age will start anew.



The dragon's tail is but a sign
For mankind's fall and man's decline.
And before this prophecy is done
I shall be burned at the stake, at one
My body singed and my soul set free
You think I utter blasphemy
You're wrong. These things have come to me
This prophecy will come to be.


These verses were on the outer wrapping of the scrolls


I know I go - I know I'm free
I know that this will come to be.
Secreted this - for this will be
Found by later dynasty



A dairy maid, a bonny lass
Shall kick this stone as she does pass
And five generations she shall breed
Before one male child does learn to read.



This is then held year by year
Till an iron monster trembling fear
eats parchment, words and quill and ink
And mankind is given time to think.



And only when this comes to be
Will mankind read this prophecy
But one man’s sweets another’s bane
So I shall not have burned in vain.


This section was kept apart from the other and it appears to have been written together yet was in a separate jar;


The signs will be there for all to read
When man shall do most heinous deed
Man will ruin kinder lives
By taking them as to their wives.



And murder foul and brutal deed
When man will only think of greed.
And man shall walk as if asleep
He does not look - he many not peep
And iron men the tail shall do
And iron cart and carriage too.



The kings shall false promise make
And talk just for talking’s sake
And nations plan horrific war
The like as never seen before
And taxes rise and lively down
And nations wear perpetual frown.



Yet greater sign there be to see
As man nears latter century
Three sleeping mountains gather breath
And spew out mud, and ice and death.
And earthquakes swallow town and town,
In lands as yet to me unknown.


And Christian one fights Christian two
And nations sigh, yet nothing do
And yellow men great power gain
From mighty bear with whom they've lain.



These mighty tyrants will fail to do
They fail to split the world in two.
But from their acts a danger bred
An ague - leaving many dead.
And physics find no remedy
For this is worse than leprosy.
Oh many signs for all to see
The truth of this true prophecy.


It is often suspected that Mother Shipton was largely a myth, and that many of her prophecies were composed by others after her death, and after the events they 'predicted'. Her prophecies were apparently recorded in a series of diaries but the first published book of her work did not appear until 1641 and the most noted work, by Richard Head, came out in 1684. Head later confessed that he had embellished almost all Shipton's biographical details, although why he did this is unknown. 


The rare collection of Mother Shipton's Prophecies was discovered by a Nexus reader who claimed that, 30 years ago, she painstakingly transcribed them and managed to smuggle them out of the Mitchell library, Sydney, now the State Library of New south Wales. 
The originals were kept in a locked room, along with many other volumes of prophetic writings deemed unsuitable for viewing by the general public. 

An interpretation of Mother Shipton’s prophecies can be read on: http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_shipton01.htm 

However one should be aware that this is just one man’s interpretation and however plausible has no basis in fact despite many of the early ones being proved true.

The Mother Shipton Moth
This day-flying moth is named after Mother Shipton, a 15th century Yorkshire prophet, due to the distinctive face and nose on the fore-wing.  It is found on a range of open, grassy habitats, including down land, heathland, low moorland, flower-rich hay meadows, woodland rides, verges and embankments.  The larvae feed on various Clovers, Black Medick, Lucerne, Common Bird’s-foot Trefoil, as well as Cock’s-foot and other grasses.

22,Constantine and the authenticity of his faith (A theory),"I have had this thought on my mind lately and thought I would share.  It is about Constantine and his very misunderstood Christian faith.  

Lately I have been reading on Aurelian and how he started worshipping Sol Invictus increasing it's popularity and using it to try and unite a Rome of many faiths.  Aurelian pretty much wanted to do what Constantine did.  (Constantine was not the first emperor to practice monotheism.) A lot of people believe Aurelian was cruel and persecuted Christians but was more neutral as he heard cases involving corruption in the Christian church and brought justice to the culprits.  Aurelian was the first Emperor to practice a form of monotheism.  

Along comes Constantine in the early 4th century and Sol Invictus was a leading cult in the military.  Aurelian opened the idea of a Roman Emperor sponsoring monotheism.  Constantine taking example from Aurelian decided to unite Rome under one religion.  Do people think that Constantine could of saw the Christian God as a form of Sol Invictus? What do people think?

I read on some articles that to be a History professor you need a good undergrad, possibly masters, and a PhD with publications and its a hellish and risky long road, but its the only thing that I love. 

There is the slim chance that i could be admitted to a good school for a masters, I fear that even if i get in and get very good grades I will still be spat upon for the rest of my life for my low undergrad GPA.

What do I do? Do i give up and do something else? If I get into a masters program and come out with amazing grades in honours n such will that overcome my low undergrad GPA when considered for a PhD candidate?

48,Question about an item and its legitimacy and potential value related to WW2,"There is an older woman (I’m guess in her late 70’s, but I don’t really know) who works at a local grocery store I regularly shop at. She is very nice, sweet and funny. She is one of those people everyone knows and loves. One afternoon she and I were talking about family heirlooms and she told me about something her husband has, but they had no idea if it really was what they thought it was and if it had any value historically or monetarily. I agreed to help her try to find out about it so I thought I might start here.

Her husband was 18-years-old and in the Navy at the end of WW2. He was stationed in Hawaii and worked as a radio/communications operator. He was on duty when the teletype came in from the Pentagon telling them that a cease fire with Japan was ordered and that the war was over. They were ordered to take that information and spread it throughout Pacific theater. 

His understanding is that this original teletype was sent to four different communications hubs and they were to spread the info from there. Hawaii happened to be one of them. They did their job and began spreading the information then he rolled the teletype up and put it in his bag. He still has it today.

So, if his understanding is accurate he is in possession of one of the four original teletypes that announced the end of WW2. It could have some serious value either monetarily or historically especially considering that he has no idea where the other three may be and if they even still exist.

My worry is that there was plenty of information about the end of the war passed out all at the same time and in the end his teletype isn’t really anything special.

I guess I am wondering if anyone might know how the word of the end of the war was spread and if this teletype might be of any historical significance.

Thanks in advance.

Finally, on January 17th, 1920, the Volstead Act went into effect. While impressive, the act had very little in the way of teeth--difficult to enforce, raids and laws had little effect against massive bootlegging operations. After twelve years, FDR repealed the Volstead Act in 1933.

He was a Mid-Upper Gunner in a [Lancaster Bomber](http://www.newsbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lancaster-bomber1.jpg) (That little bubble on the top of the plane was his spot). It was considered to be one of the most dangerous jobs in the RAF, but my grandfather was unscathed throughout the war. He didn't talk about it much, but I thought some of you would appreciate this. 

[Here's the Link to his interview, and a few pictures.](http://www.thememoryproject.com/stories/2079:stan-stanley/)

**Transcript of his Interview:**

*My name is Stan Stanley and I joined up in 1943. I left on my birthday in 1944, which is the 31st of March. I was over there and I teamed up with a crew and a pilot. He was about ten years older than us. His name was Ted Meeks. Our navigator was even older than him. He was a principal at a high school in Winnipeg. These were more father figures for us because we were really young. When I think of it, I can't believe how young we were and some of the stupid things we did.*

*Our pilot had problems seeing at night so he was always getting new glasses so that always delayed us getting into action, not that we were that anxious. We were flying every day. We were always on what were called 'cross countries,' flying over England at about eight to ten thousand feet. We'd seen all the islands outside of England, the Orkneys. It was good for us. Finally, we went into operations after he got the glasses. That was some time at the end of '44, I guess.* 

*My first trip was to Duisburg. I was a mid-upper gunner, by the way. The solenoid switch wires got caught in the mechanism up there over Duisburg. We were just getting caught in the searchlights, and my guns started going off. Didn't see much, being dark and everything, but most of them were tracers and incendiary bullets coming out of the guns. Anyway, nothing happened and we got away from the searchlights. It was a little bit of action and we were all excited about that. That was our first trip.*

*One thing that really stuck out in my mind was when we were on a daylight to Hanover. We didn't fly in formations. We used to just fly what's called a gaggle [a group of aircraft in formation]. Every airplane in the gaggle had a navigator, so we were all independent. All flew at different heights, fifty feet between each airplane. The first half of the gaggle turned north and east and started bombing the city of Frankfurt. ""Beautiful sunny day, no clouds,"" it said over the intercom. People would pay a million dollars to see this. The bombing of a huge city is something… terrifying. Something you don't see while you're doing it because you're over the city, and you're not under the airplane looking down. Even the rear gunner sees all these things as we're passing over. We don't see the actual things going on, like the incendiaries dropping like a dark cloud. But we survived…*

97,Comics in my History class (x/post Rcomicbooks),"Hi Redditors :)

I am a High-School history teacher. Currently my school is attempting to do a cross subject analysis of comic-books. Currently our English Department is looking into the X-Men issues of diversity, prejudice etc. Whilst the Art department will be creating a comic-book and ICT are looking at the branding and marketing of comic-books whilst i will be looking at the historical legacy of comic-books, particularly around the 2nd world war. I plan on doing it around this topic as it will help connect to things my class have already studied in terms of WW2.

Therefore! My question is this: What key issues/characters should i focus on? I believe the original 3 'big' superheroes were: Wonderwoman, Superman and Captain America. If i am mistaken please feel free to correct me. In essence, i am hoping that someone kind soul out there could recommend me key issues/moments i can use in my classes!

Thanks!

32,When did the UK invade Kazakhstan?,"I have been looking at the article which was put out a few years ago about the countries which England or the UK has ever 'invaded'. The piece stated that there were only 22 present day countries which had not seen English/British military action (of course, this also includes precursors to modern states).

(e.g.: http://mentalfloss.com/article/13019/there-are-only-22-countries-world-british-haven%E2%80%99t-invaded)

One thing that struck me on this occasion: it says that three of the countries which have never been invaded by the UK are Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. It therefore implies that Kazakhstan has seen British military action.

So... when was this? I have seen two suggestions from searching reddit, both of which seem to not add up:

1) Kazakhstan is an ex-Soviet state and the UK invaded the USSR during the Russian Civil War. Well, the USSR also included the three other -stans above (as did the Russian Empire, if I am not mistaken).

2) A suggestion that Kazakhstan was involved in operations during the 'Great Game'. But would these not also encompass the other -stans?

What I found was very interesting, it was the telegraph station from the line that ran from Massachusetts to France. Prior to this, messages had to cross the Atlantic on a ship, which took months.

It wasn't the first transatlantic line, but it was the first US one to France. When Charles Lindbergh landed in France, this is the station that got the message and then relayed it to NYC.

The station shut down in 1959 and then reopened as a museum. It was left exactly how the operators used it in 1959, so I felt as if I was going back in time. This was a hands on tour and I was able to use the equipment!

What was great was that the tour guide, Henri, was the last cable operator in the station back in 1959. I have an album of the place on imgur and I would like to share it here:

Even stripped of its fantastical elements, the film barely makes sense or does justice to one of the most important and beloved [stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty-seven_Ronin) in Japan of honor and selfless loyalty.

On December 14th, 1702 (according to the old Japanese calendar - January 30th, 1703 by the western one) 47 masterless samurai (ronin) attacked and killed their late master's enemy and presented his head to their master's grave.

In the previous year their lord, Asano Naganori, had been chosen to receive envoys from the Emperor and he was required to learn the intricate customs of the Imperial Court. Kira Yoshinaka/Yoshihisa was the Master of Ceremonies and he expected bribes for his instructional services. Asano did not respond and so Kira treated him roughly. Asano could take it no longer and one day attempted to kill Kira in the Shogun's castle.

Drawing a weapon much less trying to kill an official in the Shogun's castle was an instant death sentence. Asano was ordered to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) while his lands were seized and his family and retainers were dispossessed.

A group of his retainers plotted to avenge their master and get his lands returned to his family. They had to lie low because they were being watched by spies from the Shogun and Kira. Their leader, Oishi Kuranosuke, pretended to fall into destitution and debauchery to throw off the spies.

When the watch became lax, the 47 Ronin made their way to Edo (old Tokyo) and attacked Kira's residence on a snowy evening. They found Kira, beheaded him, and walked 10 kilometers to Sengaku-ji Temple to present his head to the grave of their master.

They then turned themselves over to the Shogun's authorities and awaited judgement. They feared they might be executed as common criminals but after much debate they were allowed the honor of seppuku which was a death only reserved for samurai. They were buried at the same temple as their master. Their master's land was returned to his family.

Their story became hugely popular and many plays, novels, films, TV shows, documentaries have been done on them over the centuries. The most famous depiction is the kabuki and bunraku (puppet play) [Chushingura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABshingura).

Every year on December 14th, a festival is held at the temple where the 47 Ronin are buried and many people come to pay their respects. The story strikes a chord even to this day and some scholars say ""to know the story of the 47 Ronin is to know Japan..."" (something you'd not get at all from the 2013 film but I digress)

0,What is the significance and background of the series of geographic protrusions honoring St. Michael?,"in reference to the current top post about St. Michael's Mount in England, is there any cultural/geographical significance to the series of protrusions honoring St. Michael stretching apparently from Skellig rock in Ireland, at least to Greece and maybe beyond? What is the meaning of these sites? St Michaels mount, Mont St michelle and Skellig Rock (skellig Michael) in Ireland are all points honoring St. Michael and I have a story about the latter, but first, look on a map, all these sites line up perfectly in a straight line. Curiously enough they also line up with Damascus, Turin, Greece, Cyprus. It was told to me these sites were chosen specifically for religious purposes in with some broader geographic significance. Story: I made the boat trip to Skellig rock in 2011 while visiting with friends in Kenmare, when one of two experiences in Ireland that made me believe in something magical/supernatural occurred. Two alien looking dudes from Switzerland were on the boat with the random group of ten making the trip. The one who spoke, Arund, was visited by the Archangel Michael and continues to be in touch with God through him. He follows his heart. His heart and St. Michael have told him he needs to bury a crystal from his mother’s mountain in Switzerland on the top of Skellig Michael (the part of Skellig the monks lived on, did I mention this is a UNESCO world heritage site worth seeing?). He was proud to whip out his crystal, which was massive, from his pocket. His next mission was to put one on top of Mont St. Michel in France, and then follow up on other spots all the way down to Greece. Apparently all the sites of St. Michael rise unexpectedly out of surrounding land and happen to form a straight line across Europe. Arund played a strange flute, like a hillbilly didgeridoo piccolo before we did some deep sea fishing. He caught 3 fish, no one else on the boat caught anything. We sang sang and spent a lot of time talking about love, God, life, the universe. It was a trip.",history,1417842340,[deleted],3,12,True,2014-12-06

52,150 years ago the Pickett's Charge of the West - the Battle of Franklin took place (US Civil War),"On November 30, 1864 the Confederate Army of Tennessee under General John Bell Hood struck Union forces led by General John M Schofield an old West Point classmate of his at [Franklin, Tennessee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Franklin_(1864) in one of the bloodiest battles of the entire war. 20000 men crossed a 2-mile stretch under murderous cannon and musket fire to attack an entrenched position in what some call the [Pickett's Charge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickett%27s_Charge) of the West. 

Much of the battle was actually fought at night as the battle started at four and ended around nine. In the aftermath, Union dead was under 200 while Confederate dead was almost 2000 including six generals. Some say Hood was under the influence of pain medication due to his severe injuries of losing a leg and the use of an arm. Others say he was angry at his missed opportunity to destroy Schofield's forces at [Spring Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Spring_Hill) and punished his army by making frontal assaults. And some said Hood thought the Union center weak and he needed to destroy that army before it got to Nashville, his main objective.

Amazingly, Hood declared Franklin a victory because the Union retreated (which was their objective anyway) and he limped his army towards Nashville where the remnant of his army was smashed two weeks later. The war itself would end in April of the following year.

One of the saddest stories is Todd Carter whose family home was the focal point of some of the fiercest hand-to-hand combat. He charged saying he was almost home and was riddled with bullets. He died in his own home a few days later.

96,My great grandfather went to WWI and I found his war record,"My great grandfather died when I was very young but I remember him and always liked to hear stories that my other family members told about him.

He went to WWI with the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps ( in portuguese, Corpo Expedicionário Português or just CEP ) and when I got older I started to write small things I was told about his war stories. 

Then I tried to find his records that the army should still have. It wasn't easy and took quite a long time but I finally found them this summer.
Here it is: http://imgur.com/QKVOJ4o

It is a simply record but it allowed me to confirm some of the stories I had already heard. He fought in the battle of the Lys, was injured near the end and then returned to the front as a stretcher bearer.

When he returned, his family thought he was dead so they had already sold all his stuff. Then he ended up working at CP ( the Portuguese railroads ) because I had learned how to read and write in the war and at that time that was a big advantage.

Later he received a medal ( unfortunately, I have no clue about where that is or if it still exists ) was one of the last Portuguese WWI soldiers to die. 
I know that some guy tried to write a book with his war stories but he didn't allowed. I don't know why but I supposed he didn't like the idea of someone making money with his stories.

I wasn't sure if I should put this in /r/history or in /r/wwi so I'll put in both...

33,What biography has completely changed your perception of a certain historical figure - for better or for worse?,"My two answers:

FOR WORSE: ""Van Gogh: A Life"" by Naifeh &amp; Smith.  My whole life I bought into the idea of VVG as a misunderstood, innocent genius who wasn't appreciated during his lifetime because of the ignorance of others (e.g. the basic gist of Don McLean's ""Vincent"").  Wow, was I wrong.  This book made it crystal clear that VVG was a complete and utter twat for the vast majority of his short life.  He was a financial leech, a egocentric moralist, and just an all-over selfish prick.  I still love his paintings, but yeah, check him off my list of historical figures I'd like to have a beer with.  

FOR BETTER: ""Nixon"" (3 Vols) by Stephen Ambrose.  Yes, he was paranoid.  Yes, he was obsessed with political payback.  All of that is laid out clearly in these books.  But Ambrose really made me admire Richard Nixon in a way I never had before.  Say what you will about his character faults, the guy was a damned hard worker and pulled himself out of absolutely nothing to the highest position in the the world.  On top of that, his political and legislative accomplishments (when viewed objectively) are pretty damned amazing.  If he wasn't so possessed with his own inferiority complex he may well have made the list of top 10 presidents of all time.

I have been doing some reading (fun book: The Human Tradition in Colonial Latin America) on the 1600's period, especially in Brazil.

It seems like it was more of a big show than a serious attempt to eliminate native religion, although of course some inquisitors were very serious.

46,My great aunt Elvy's translated journals- update,"Sorry I haven’t posted lately. I have been absurdly busy. I’m not sure if anyone is interested in this. 

Also sorry for spelling mistakes and shit. I ended my work  week with a concussion. I plan to use that as an excuse for a long time.


May (?) 1940


Artur got me the most amazing present! I’m so happy I can’t sit still for more than a moment!
It’s a camera. A Kodak retina. I love it. I love the feeling of it my hands, the sensation of being able to freeze time – it’s intoxicating! I always wanted to have a camera, ever since that midsummer when a photographer visisted the village and we had a family photo taken. It’s magic!


Not even the fact that the war is thrundering around us can put a lid on my cheerfulness – Katja says it’s inapprorpitate to be happy in times of such horror, but then Katja does not have a camra either. Or Artur.


I can not belive how wonderful my life has become since I ran away that December night. I have the most handsome, adventurous man in my life and we plan to have an extraordinary life together.



May 26 1940


Artur wants us to leave Europe. He feels that the war is expanding so fast and the future does seem rather bleak. Who knows where it will end? What if we are invaded next, where will we go? We are surrounded already, a sitting duck.


He says that we should try and travel to America. He dreams of training new pilots there, to open his own school. He says that everyone who wants to should learn to fly – that it is much better than driving a car. Sometimes he kisses his Cessna good night, right on the nose. I love his passion for his job!


I want to see Europe but since Europe is burning that might not be the best idea, he says. But it is here that history is happening, it is here that I should travel with my Retina and document the horrors, the hopes, the time as it passes by.


We have not yet decided where to go. But we want out. Out of this town where we feel cornered and short of breath. There is a world to see and I want it all. Even the burned bits and the nightmares. 

To turn a blind eye is to hide from the reality, and I want my life to be real. Artur says I am both naïve and brave. Truth is I am only more curious than I am frightend – even if only just.


May 1940 Date unknown


I went to a café today with some of the girls from lottorna (Eleanore85: no idea what it is).
To my utter disappointment they only had mock cream cakes. Mock cream, I now know, is made of margarine, sugar, and milk powder. How dreadful!



I hope that we soon decide on where to go. And how to get there. Travling is becoming increasingly dangerous and difficult. But I also find the thought of us battling the dangers and obstacles rather thrilling!
As long as I get to fall asleep in his arms at night I don’t care if it’s on a train across a war zoon or under the stars on a blanket made of moss.


Eleanore85: In case someone is longing for some pieces from her travling years, here's something for you, right at the beginning of the travling madness era:


Artur took me flying this weekend, we were flying low, I could smell the autumn frost on the grass below and the sky is was blushing pink, a sure sign that summer is getting ready to step back and let nature explode in a chaos of color.


There is a new sharpness in the air- how I love this time of year! I am an autumn child at heart, mother always said.
When others got depressed that the light was diminishing, I was overjoyed at the pure sight of the leaves changing. This is, I assume, what I shall miss the most when we go. 

Because we are getting ready to leave - like a pair of nomads, air gypsies always on the go. As if some unseen foe was chasing us from country to country – only the foe is our own burning urge to see the world, to inhale every last bit of it’s magnificence.


The other night I couldn’t sleep. When he woke up, with his arms resting comfortingly around my waist he asked me what was wrong. 

I’m afraid, I said. 


Afraid? He asked. Of what? We have lived through wars together and you never looked afraid, what is it that scares you? He asked, a concerned note blending with the normal optimism in his voice.

 I’m afraid that our lives are slowing down. What if it comes to a halt? What if this is it? Now we have survived the tests and this is what is left? Comfortable, secure boredom in a big house in a good neighberhood? I crave adventure, I hunger for the unkown. I want to ride a horse across a desert or sleep in huts in an exotic jungle. I want to stand on the cliff of a mountain and feel my stomach turn as I look down. I want to sleep under the stars in a country where unfamiliar winds rock us to sleep. I want to pack a small bag, travel light and far.
As far away as possible, to something new and exciting that makes my heart tremble and my soul soar

.
As far away as possible? He asked, amused now. That would be New Zealand. Would it make you happy if we moved to New Zealand? Instead of buying the house? (Eleanore85: they had been looking at a house to buy, Artur had inherited a larger sum of money).

 I turned around and buried my face in his chest and smiled. Yes, I purred. Let’s go! ",history,1415480206,eleanore85,6,9,True,2014-11-08

Had it carbon dated by the Winchester Heritage Museum in Kentucky. It dates to between 1840 and 1848. Possibly Kentucky 4th Regiment Calvalry Flag. Possibly used during Spanish-American War.

It looks like our Kentucky Commonwealth Flag, but strangely it does not have Daniel Boone in it. Anybody know what we got here?

42,Passing into history...,"I was reading some old Reddit threads and came across a reference to ""freedom fries"" - in reference to the alleged practice of removing the term ""French"" from American cultural items in reaction to the perceived reluctance of France to support a US invasion of Iraq.

I expected at least one of the comment replies to mention that the practice was a joke, nobody took the ""freedom fries"" thing seriously, and the media just latched on to it as a lighthearted story to run between otherwise serious stories.

Instead, I've found that more and more often, the ""freedom fries"" thing is accepted as fact; that it wasn't just ""Debbie's Diner"" changing their chalkboard menu for a couple of weeks, but a nationwide change to Freedom Fries, Freedom Toast, etc.  Anybody who was alive at the time knows better.

This isn't really about Freedom Fries as much as it is a chance to discuss the passing of an event from the contemporary into the historical.  With every historical event, there comes a certain set of cultural perceptions or a certain mythology.

What are some events that will soon pass from contemporary to historical?  What misconceptions are forming around them?

I considered this for /r/askhistorians, but, it seems a little broad for them.

EDIT:  I know this is going to come up - yes, I am aware that the three cafeterias for the US House of Representatives also went with ""Freedom Fries.""  My point is, it's not like McDonalds or somebody did it.",history,1414901532,ddsilver,115,170,True,2014-11-02

TL:DR
Is the German's military actually weak and they manage to beat France due to unique conditions at that time?
Was Nazi Germany's economy actually weak and near economic failure, if so why people often say Hitler solve Germany's economic problems, are these facts or just propaganda?

My grandfather was Frank ""Shorty"" Harris. I just found out there are hundreds of pages of ""history"" about him on the Web, 3/4 of which is contradictory, and of the 1/4 that is agreed upon, I've seen documents that show some of it to be false, and some to be misleading. Is history always like this?

Normally, documents like newspaper stories are considered more reliable than eyewitness and second hand accounts, told years after his death, but when the newspapers and historical societies contradict each other so completely, how do historians sort things out? I'm getting on toward the end of my life, and my second-hand versions of my father's first hand accounts will soon enough be lost. Comparing the colorful accounts at the Death Valley and Nevada Historical Societies with the stories, photos, and title deeds that I have seen, I get the feeling that writing history is a lot like making stew: Authors, like cooks, spice up the story with alien ingredients, and leave out the bitter parts.

And while everyone knows that name “Iran-Contra” and some understand what it actually was, it’s almost as if it’s a footnote the Reagan legacy and Presidential history in general. Watergate is so notorious that the –gate suffix is attached to every scandal since and until the end of time.

50,My great aunt Elvy's translated journals part 4,"April 11, 1940


A german air plane has been shot down! How neutral of us, don’t you think?


This neutrality confuses me a great deal. I’m might lack both political and military knowledge on the matter – but I think “neutral” means something else to those people.


On one hand we tried to help Finland, on the other we didn’t want to officially do so. We do nothing when Norway and Denmark are invaded, and we don’t seem to argue when Germany want to use our railroads. But we still shoot them down when given the chance. “A Swedish tiger” – a confusing concept if you ask me.


With Germany taking over Norway we have tried to secure our borders better. But I feel we have no true capacity to do so. I think the politicians just try to keep us from panicking, as if we don’t think for ourselves.


Karl-Erik told Artur that German planes are crossing over Swedish territory, and the Sweidsh military lack equipment to do much about it. I don’t know if it’s a joke or the truth, but he said that the värnpliktiga (conscripted?) tried to ”aim” at the airplanes with telephone poles, hoping that the Germans would fear that they were under threat.


Artur’s father is worried about his business. The lack of fuel for transportation makes it difficult for him to keep his clients, but there is no way to get hold of petrol. Only the military and the firefighters can buy it, I heard that the police were all out this week. 
The “gengas” isn’t enough either.



April 15


One thing in the middle of all this madness still makes me hopeful. With all our boys busy protecting the borders, the girls get a shot at working in the industry. I spoke the girls at the post office, and many women are being hired in the industries now, in all sorts of jobs! 
 This is a movement I find highly interesting! Perhaps the world will finally see that girls are just as capable. But I’d say we would be useful along the borders as well – you don’t need to be male to handle a gun.


I feel I should write about Norway, about the battles raging so close to us. But the truth is that it scares me to read about it. The knowledge that if Norway and the allies fail, there is nothing between us and the enemy. And I feel that fortune might not be in our favor.


Last night Artur and Bertil took a large map and placed it on the sitting room table. They started to draw lines all over it, showing the progress of the war. It was truly a dreadful sight!


Narvik is at risk, but the Brits and the French are helping out. A few days ago the British jagare (Eleanore85; I’m gonna go ahead and guess that a jagare is a ship of some kind) managed to attack a few German ships. Thank god the Brits are here to help. It’s a shame we are obviously not.


Tonight we are having guests over, I’ll get to meet some more of Artur’s friends. We’ve got hold of of some sugar and are debating is we should bake a sockerkaka or perhaps just save it. 
We’re out off coffee but I refuse to drink surr (no idea). But we’ll cook a nice duck and there are plenty of veggies. How I wish I had the chance to cook a real northern meal…One day I shall.

When I bought Rome2: Total War, I only have a minute knowledge of Rome. When I say minute, I meant, I only know about Julius Caesar, no dates nor title just him but i do know the city. As I reach the 50 hrs mark on that game, It had occurred to me that I must replicate the expansion of the empire in the game to make it even more interesting so I started researching about Rome. I started with the beginning of the Republic and how it was form out of the ashes of their Etruscan ruler. Then back to mythological beginning of Rome, Remus and Romulus, and understood the irony of Romulus killing Remus which will matter at the end of the republic. Then to Livy's book the History of Rome which he believes that knowing the history of the empire is the key for the success of the empire. So anyway, poof, while researching about the civil war a thought, which was the question I've ask above. I asked my friend a bout it and we had an interesting conversation about topic yet we can only think of a reasonable answer somehow. I ""google"" it at first but all I end up getting as a result is the civil war which is not very helpful.

68,Here is the carpet from the car JFK was shot in,"My friends uncle worked at Ford and worked on restoring the car JFK was assassinated in. 

Here is an excerpt from his email The carpet is actually made out of mouton which is dyed lamb's wool.  This was very common in very high end automobiles and fine home furnishings.  It was cut and sewn to fit the presidential limousine for JFK.  The car was built in 1963 by Ford Motor Co's Lincoln division, and code named SS-X100 by the secret service.  
The photos I have sent you show the top and backside of the carpet.  In the close-up of the backside you can see bloodstains from the controversial shooting in Dallas on that fateful day.  The event remains to this day one of the greatest and most infamous ""unsolved"" murder/assasinations in human history.
  
The SS-X100 is now on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, and is considered the most famous automobile in history!
 
No one has seen this carpet since it was removed from the car a few days after the assassination occurred! Because it disappeared  immediately it was never included in any of the investigations that followed such as the infamous Warren Commission Report.""

Napoleon did the same thing during his time (invaded when winter was near) and lost most of his men, which severely weakened his empire's fighting force. 

Did Hitler invade the Soviet Union purely because of his ego or did he pay no heed to what happened to Napoleon? Or am I missing something else entirely?

**For those interested**

The rest of the documents show he joined the 2nd Australian Imperial Force in 1940 having lied about his age (he was 41 and said he was 39).

Posted to North Africa he fought in an armored unit against the Italians and Afrika Corp, fighting at both Tobruk and El Alamein. He was then posted to a field maintenance unit elsewhere in North Africa to put to use his civilian trade as an oxywelder and mechanic. He remained there where he got dysentery, according to his letters a nurse from the same small town as him back in Australia obtained treatment for him at a US field hospital further back from the front to which he owes his survival to.

Having been weakened by disease we was posted back to Australia as a Corporal still in an armored maintained unit when he crashed the Foxhound. Like most motorised brigades in the Australian Army he was not posted to the Pacific theater and instead remained in Australia for the duration.

31,"Q: It’s 1961, the height of the Cold War, the U.S. has 40 nuclear-capable Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles--how many ICBMs did the Soviets have?","According to Daniel Ellsberg’s *SECRETS: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers* (2002):

&gt;However, in the fall of 1961 a highly secret, dramatically revised national intelligence estimate turned the strategic world that had preoccupied me for three years upside down. The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commander’s estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera. 

&gt;...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate.

**THREAT INFLATION**

------------------------

The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article ""Follow the Money"" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

------------------------------

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effect—“war could come at any time”—was solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: “As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available.” And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, “war scares,” otherwise known as “**threat inflation**” would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that “intelligence” had revealed an ominous “gap” between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The “missile gap” on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies’ capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful “gaps” of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didn’t announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon “whistleblower” of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, “every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up!” In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

40,"202 years ago, the tide turned for Napoleon","At an otherwise inconsequential little village near Moscow, two of the largest armies of the era met on September 7th, 1812.  The French army of almost 200,000 commanded by Napoleon would engage a Russian force of some 150,000 under Kutusov and achieve a tactical victory, driving the Russians from the field.  Prior to this, the Russian army had been fighting a well organized strategic withdrawal, Kutusov daring the wroth of the Emperor and the displeasure of his fellow generals to keep the Russian army from engaging the French.

Kutusov did not want to have a battle at Borodino, but ultimately was pressured into fighting by his emperor, who, along with the Russian nobility, felt that giving up Moscow without a fight would be seen as unforgivable by history and the Russian people.  So it was that Borodino became one of the great names of history.

Ultimately, though, despite his capture of Moscow, the engagement was not the victory Napoleon wanted, for the Russian army remained in the field.  Napoleon waited for a month, expecting the Russians to surrender.  As temperatures dropped in October, Napoleon made the decision to retreat.  The Russians constantly harried Napoleon with partisans and light cavalry, especially the famous Cossacks, whom the French army came to dread.

By the time he emerge from Russia, the once half-million strong 'Grand Armee' had been reduced to fewer than ten thousand men.  Napoleon's ""Allies"" in Austria and Prussia were preparing to betray him, and the Russian army was in hot pursuit.  As he withdrew back to France, the largest battle of the era would take place at Leipzig, an apocalyptic engagement with some half-million troops involved on all sides and nearly a hundred thousand casualties.

The campaign would finally come to a close with the occupation of Paris, Alexander I leading the combined coalition force into the city with his fellow monarchs at the head of the Russian lifeguard cavalry.",history,1410046982,OMGSPACERUSSIA,90,562,True,2014-09-06

88,The naivety of European leaders in 1914,"It's pretty sad how the entire cause of WWI really depended on the personalities of the leaders.  Arrogance, stupidity and thoughtlessness were characteristics of virtually every leader of state.  They all thought their enemy wanted them dead;they all believed in the superiority of their own country, but fundamentally they all refused to believe they had any real control over the situation.  That's pretty much the argument of Why Nations Go to War, a book by John G. Stoessinger.  Everything is in the hands of Fate, and if Germany mobilizes it's God's fault.  Kaiser, Czar Nicholas, and Berchtold, the foreign minister of Austria, all had saw themselves as honorable men who loved their country.  They didn't give an inkling of thought to the viewpoint though the eyes of the adversary -- Berchtold never stopped to consider what Serbia thought of the Austrian invasion. Aggression? Impossible, to him it was defending the honor of Austria. To Serbia and Russia it was an obvious display of inconsideration towards the sovereignty of a nation.  
Pretty pathetic.

Teniendo esto en cuenta (y si no cambiara mucho la intención de voto de aquí a las siguientes elecciones autonómicas), nos podriamos encontrar el siguiente resultado en muchas comunidades:

1º PP
2º Podemos
3º PSOE

PP + PSOE Mayoría absoluta
PODEMOS + PSOE Mayoría absoluta
Ningun otro pacto (aparte del imposible Podemos + PP) llevaría a una mayoría absoluta.

Este resultado es bastante probable en Asturias, Com. Madrid, Com. Valenciana, Navarra, Baleares y Aragón (y quizás alguna mas como Canarias, Cantabria o Galicia)

¿Que creeis que haría el PSOE en estos casos?

¿Abstenerse?
¿Dar el voto, solo para la investidura, al PP o a Podemos?
¿Entrar en el gobierno con PP o Podemos?

En mi opinión pactar con el PP en las autonómicas sería suicidarse para las generales (en las generales si sería mas posible que pactaran con el PP).

Entrar en el gobierno con Podemos no sería seguramente planteable, pues sería rechazado por Podemos.

Así que las dos opciones mas probables serían abtenerse (dejando gobernar al PP en minoría) o dar el voto para la investidura a Podemos.

It brought tears to my eyes. I thought that this quote, originally written about Stalingrad in WWII, was even more appropriate for WWI:
&gt;""What an immeasurable wealth of human happiness, human plans, hopes, talents, fertile possibilities for the future, were thereby being destroyed forever. The criminal insanity of an irresponsible war management with its superstitious belief in technology and its utter lack of feeling for the life, value, and dignity of man, had here prepared a hell on earth for us. Of what importance was the individual in his uniqueness and distinctiveness? He felt himself as if extinguished and used up as raw material in a demonic machine of destruction.

69,WW2 Submarines - how did they set the torpedoes and how long did it really take?,"I've seen movies like ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""Torpedo Run"", and Hollywood makes it look like their torpedoes were computer controlled.  The Captain merely had to say, ""4 Torpedoes - spread at 5 degree intervales, depth 12 feet, distance 800 years"", then Wham - they hit the fire button.  In real life, how was all of this done?  First, how did the Captain know all of those complex geometric values - do 20 years of experience really teach you to think that fast?  Second, how fast can the crew react to those orders - can they program all of that with simple dials while the torpedo is already in the tube?

What is the reality of aiming, setting, then firing a torpedo in WW2?

Edit: Great answers for how the Captain figured out the data values.  Completely numb about how the crew interpreted the orders and implemented them in a timely manner.  I was really hoping for someone who knew.

I still want to know: did the crew have to have direct access to the torpedo - before loading into a tube - in order to set speed, depth, spread, etc., or could they do this while the torpedo was in the tube?  If it was before the tube, which is what I think was needed, then how long did it take to dial in the values THEN hoist the torpedo into the selected tube?

Hollywood would suggest that the moment the Captain had a solution, the crew could/did respond within seconds.  I'm asking how long this delay actually lasted?  In my mind, the Captain barked his values, the crew implemented them, THEN it took another 10 minutes to hoist the torpedo into the proper tube.

And screw Hollywood - I'm now attacking games.  Have you ever played a game where it took 10 minutes to respond to an order?

SO - what was it like IN REAL LIFE?

Some of the first restaurants opened post revolution because the courts chefs needed work. One of the causes of the citizens anger was because of the failed grain crops two years in a row but the court continued to live opulently taking far more resources including food than was fair. There were food riots amongst the French house wives and the court held feasts as a way to thumb it's nose at the citizens. The wars post revolution was impacted by food and resource supplies. So here's my question.

55,Live Air Raid on London (Buzz Bombs) - [OC],"During WWII, my grandfather worked as a broadcaster for the Office of War Information. Primarily they broadcast allied news out of London. I digitized some of the LPs that they cut in studio (some broadcasts, a live air raid, etc). And I figured that you all might appreciate these tracks.

The first is a live recording, cut from the studio or the rooftop, of an air raid on London. It is complete with sirens, buzz bomb engines, and a few explosions.

[Live Air Raid] (https://soundcloud.com/popeonabomb/live-air-raid-on-london) 

They did not broadcast this other track, but they did cut it and send the LP back for friends and family to listen to. I am unaware if they recorded this during a live air raid, or if they used previously captured audio. I like to imagine them letting off stress by making light of the serious situation that they were in.

[Air Raid Prank] (https://soundcloud.com/popeonabomb/air-prank) 

I apologize for the audio quality, but the records that these came from had to survive WWII, being shipped across the Atlantic, and the process of aging for 75 years.

Later, not any time soon, I will add some of the audio that they actually broadcast live (news, prisoner information, etc).

14,A question concerning the Axis Powers,"I have been studying the role of Imperial Japan in World War II and currently I am researching the relations between the Axis Powers. I have thus far read that especially Germany showed interest in Japan's proposal to jointly attack the Soviet Union. This plan was in the end never fully carried out, due to the fact that Germany delayed it's plans for invading the Soviet Union and Japan showing more interests in conquering parts of Southeast-Asia and the Pacific.

But I was wondering if, aside of the joint attack on the Soviet Union and various cultural exchanges, there would be any other cooperation between especiially germany and Japan but perhaops also Italy and Japan?",history,1407588512,Hokzwijn,8,13,True,2014-08-09

The kid was probably surrounded by servants all the time, but I can´t imagine that they had the right to hit someone who were seen as a better person. 
Or did the noble children have their own courts, like the royal family did, consisting of other nobles who had the right to discipline the child, or how did it work?

The reason I ask if they had a court is that it kind of makes sense that another noble who were set to supervise the child were seen as someone ""worthy"" of correcting someone noble since they had titles themselves.

I'm most interested in opinions and discussion on the following:

1. Given Texas not having the military power to force Native American tribes into submission, what would be the status of those tribes today? Reservations weren't established until later, and the narrative would be greatly served by the Comanche and other tribes acting with the agency of a strong tribal community.
2. To what degree, if any, would Texas have retained the frontier/border ethos of 'every man for himself', without the rest of America's culture to drag it more toward modern civilization?
3. Assuming global events unfolded in a similar fashion as in real life, how do you see Texas participating in the bigger events?
4. How would Texas never joining the union affect the desire of the South to secede and the American Civil War? Would it have happened at all?
5. How would an independent nation between America and Mexico affect Mexican drug cartels and the modern drug trade?
6. What would the modern spoken language and slang look like? Would Indian dialects and Spanish be as prevalent as English?
7. What major differences would the modern Republic of Texas' system of laws and justice have from America's? Relevant issues include abortion, religious freedom, tribal laws, gun control, abolition of slavery, equal rights, nuclear weapons, economic systems, the war on drugs, the war on terror, and anything else that stands out to you.

Interesting responses about anything I haven't listed or thought of (I'm sure there are many) are welcome as well.

I do understand that the answer to this question is a bit time dependent. In the early middle ages you could probably call yourself a king ruling 3 huts and one cow, but I'm guessing later on it was all a bit more regulated. E.g. the kingdoms of Holland and Belgium were created, but how was e.g. some bloke made king of France and not just a chieftain, duke, aedelman,...

After a longer-than-desired hiatus, /r/HistoryNetwork's Historical Figure AMA is back this week featuring composer and pianist Scott Joplin.

[Here](http://www.scottjoplin.org/biography/) you'll find a short biography of Joplin's life. Also, I asked our host to provide a favorite piece of his, so that you all could get a feel for his music, and this is what I received:

&gt; Here's Joplin's [""The Easy Winners""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AQ51THxBhw&amp;t=3), a ragtime two-step from 1901. It's performed by Joshua Rifkin, who is a famous classical pianist who helped revive ragtime's reputation as serious music in the 1970's ragtime revival.

&gt;Furthermore, Marvin Hamlisch's version of this piece was featured on the soundtrack of ""The Sting"" (1973), which was another major factor in the revival of this American music.

We're very much looking forward to this AMA, and we hope you're looking forward to it as well.

88,reddit 101,"## What is reddit, really?  

* Don't think of reddit as one giant community. This site is made up of ""sub""reddits, which are all their own communities. Every single post you see on this site belongs to its own community, with its own set of users, and with its own set of rules. reddit provides you an easy-to-use interface for managing what posts you see by letting you subscribe or unsubscribe from certain subreddits.  

* By making an account, you are automatically subscribed to a set of [""default"" subreddits](http://i.imgur.com/4PxSX4e.png) which are a set of highly popular communities that the administrators of this site feel would give the average person an interesting first experience.  

* Don't like one or more of these default subreddits? Use the ""unsubscribe"" button on the sidebar, and start customizing your reddit front page! Find subreddits that interest *you*. Many subreddits feature lists of ""similar subreddits"" that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don't know its name? Try /r/findareddit! Finally, try setting up a [multi-reddit](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) to categorize your subreddit list even further! 

## Tips for your account.  

* [See and change your preferences.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) Customize how many [comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZDka3tA.png) show up, what kind of [posts](http://i.imgur.com/FqnC5e2.png) show up, [and more](http://i.imgur.com/vFrZ1C9.png)!  

* [Verify your e-mail.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) If you don't do this and you lose your password, you will have no way to log back onto that account. Ever. Please do this!  

* Karma is a point system that lets you know how your submissions or comments are doing. The more karma your post has, the more people have upvoted it. Generally a higher karma count on a post means that the community of that subreddit found your post valuable and interesting. Your karma is logged on your user page on the top right. **Please note that self-posts earn you no karma.** Only comments and link-posts do.

## What is the sidebar?  

* The [""sidebar""](http://i.imgur.com/OVtMd4K.png) is the list of information pertaining to a specific subreddit. At the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit. It also contains the link to ""subscribe/unsubscribe"" from that subreddit. Underneath that it generally lists the rules, guidelines, relevant information, similar subreddits, etc.  

    **Note:** many mobile reddit apps require you to press a certain button for the sidebar to show up. Every subreddit has a sidebar. Please don't forget to look for it even if your app doesn't immediately show it! [Here's an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps.](http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0)

* You should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit, and if you don't understand a rule message the moderators to ask. This ensures that your post stays on the subreddit, as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed.

* Have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit? Ask the moderators there! [Here's an image](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) that shows you where you can typically find the link to message the mods.  


## Who are moderators? What do they do?  

* Each subreddit is a community with its own focus. The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, /r/android is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, /r/apple is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products.  

* Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to *only the subreddits they moderate.* They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit. Moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar, so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good!  

## Who are admins? What do they do?  

* [Meet the admins.](http://www.reddit.com/about/team) The admins are like super-moderators. They have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more. They are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users.

* The admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits, letting the moderators and the community decide how its run. **However,** the admins will enforce the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) on every subreddit. Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a **sitewide ban**, or the closing down of a subreddit.  



## What is reddiquette?  

* [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is an **informal** set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit. As reddit has grown, certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged. reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you aren't left wondering why your posts aren't well-received. You might not be banned not following reddiquette, but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you don't.  



## Help! What happened to my post?  

* reddit is a huge forum with millions of users. Many posts are made here every day. Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don't fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it's not showing up. *Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it! It's a shared inbox!*  

    * *I can still see my post but others say they can't?*  
    Nothing is really removed from reddit, if a mod removes something it is de-listed for others to see. You can still see it with a direct link.  

    * *My post was removed because it was spam? What gives?*
    Spam is a tricky subject, reddit has several base rules but much of it is left for moderators to decide. reddit's [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) has a good section explaining it.



## I have a great idea for a subreddit!

* Awesome! [Message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) so you can talk to them  

## I have a great idea for reddit as a site!

* Awesome too! Post it in /r/ideasfortheadmins  

## What if I don't like the moderators or how the subreddit is run?  

* That's okay, reddit was built to handle just that! First though, make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there aren't any misunderstandings, or if you can't just compromise. Otherwise, make your own community! [Here is an excellent guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101) for starting and moderating your own subreddit.  

* Moderators are people, too, so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns. We care about the communities we help run and would hate to see users leave because of something that we can help fix!  




## What if I need help with something else?  

* Try /r/help for general help on reddit. /r/askmoderators can also help you out if you need to ask mods about anything.  

## I think I found a bug.

* Uh oh. If you are using an application or extension, most have a subreddit you can post in! (/r/RESIssues, /r/alienblue, /r/redditisfun). If you found a bug with reddit itself, post it to /r/bugs (more serious issues should be sent directly to the reddit security team: see the /r/bugs sidebar for contact information.)  


##Other Subreddits of Note

* Other good subreddits to check out for help with various topics are /r/Modhelp, /r/Modnews, /r/ChangeLog, /r/Blog, and /r/Announcements.

&gt; 
&gt;The renowned blogger and Middle East expert Juan Cole illuminates the role of today's Arab youth — who they are, what they want, and how they will affect world politics.
&gt;
&gt;Beginning in January 2011, the revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests, riots, and civil wars that comprised what many call ""the Arab Spring"" shook the world. These upheavals were spearheaded by youth movements, and yet the crucial role they played is relatively unknown. Middle East expert Juan Cole is here to share their stories.
&gt;
&gt;For three decades, Cole has sought to put the relationship of the West and the Muslim world in historical context. In *The New Arabs* he outlines the history that led to the dramatic changes in the region, and explores how a new generation of men and women are using innovative notions of personal rights to challenge the authoritarianism, corruption, and stagnation that had afflicted their societies.
&gt;
&gt;Not all big cohorts of teenagers and twenty-somethings necessarily produce movements centered on their identity as youth, with a generational set of organizations, symbols, and demands rooted at least partially in the distinctive problems besetting people of their age. The Arab Millennials did. And, in a provocative and optimistic argument about the future of the Arab world, *The New Arabs* shows just how they did it.",history,1404666485,cosmical,0,19,True,2014-07-06

This page indicates that ""5 rounds"" was a given number of early versions of this shell to destroy a B-17 bomber. Also indicates that the fuel tanks were the target of German pilots.

4,The Radio Room: Russian Watches In Action (And How The Titanic Changed Everything),"The year is 1912 and it’s a cold April night as the Titanic speeds its way through iceberg-infested waters in the north Atlantic. I’m sure you all see where this is going so I will spare you further James Cameron-esque imagery and simply remind you that tragedy struck the luxury liner in the form of an iceberg, dooming what was thought to be an “unsinkable” ship.

Thousands of lives were lost needlessly and not simply because the ship sank; many factors aided in making that night a true tragedy instead of simply a failed voyage. One of those factors was communication and the complete lack of regulation over an international system.

That night there were huge amounts of chatter over the radio waves, and as the Titanic sent out its distress signal she found it hard to get through to other ships. The ones that it did get through to were either too far or too late.

Building off the Berlin convention of 1906, the United States, with other countries following suit, passed the Act to Regulate Radio Communication in August of 1912, which became more widely known as the “Radio Room Act.”

This act stipulated, among many other things, that radio rooms on the shore or any sea-going ship must be manned 24 hours by a minimum of two trained and licensed operators so as to intercept any and all distress signals.

Unfortunately, the last United States WWI veteran, Frank Buckles, died in 2011, and was buried at Arlington Cemetary, despite his lack of combat experience, making him ineligible for burial there, due to help from Ross Perot and Buckles' family and friends. In addition, the last veteran to serve in the Trenches, Harry Patch of England, died in 2011. The absolute last WWI veteran, Florence Green of England died February 4th, 2012. Thus, we can no longer really get anymore first-hand accounts of what it was like to really fight in WWI, but their legacy lives on through their families, and documented accounts of the stories they told upon their return from the battlefield.

According to Jones, the standard infantry battle array was three ranks, the first rank kneeling, the second rank slightly crouching, and the third rank standing upright so all ranks could fire their muskets without any obstructions.

This got me thinking: has there ever been an army at the time that trained its first rank to go prone instead of kneeling? I figure going prone would make the first rank a really difficult target to hit with a musket ball, and the array could add an extra rank for more firepower. One could have four ranks: one prone, one kneeling, one crouching, and one standing.

Thank you to /u/davidreiss666 for allowing me to post this here.

After noticing a decline in activity on /r/AncientGreek, I have decided that I would try to encourage more traffic by garnering interest in weekly group discussions. The idea would be to read a short selection of ancient Greek drama, poetry, or prose (such as Euripides, Hesiod, or Plato) and to discuss interpretive questions about the texts. Further, we will select a shorter passage in the original Greek to translate (for those of us who can read ancient Greek), and we will discuss any grammatical or stylistic questions that arise. If you are interested in participating in either of these activities, please feel free to subscribe to /r/AncientGreek and to leave a reply to the ""[[META] Activity Inquiry](http://www.reddit.com/r/AncientGreek/comments/26znk5/meta_activity_inquiry/)"" post.

Sparta: ""If.""

*A Nightmare's Prayer: A Marine Harrier Pilot's War in Afghanistan* - Good read, especially if you love aviation.


**Gulf War/90's**


*Bravo Two Zero* - SAS scud hunting mission and survival after being found. (Very sad, decision to not shoot a young boy who saw them led to their own deaths. Great book.

**World War II**



*The Commandant* - Short, written by the Commandant of Auschwitz

*Battle of Leyte Gulf* - WW2

*Baghdad at Sunrise* - Iraqi Freedom

*The Boys of Pointe Du Hoc* - WW2

*Hitler's Willing Executioners* - WW2

*Mein Kampf* - It has a stigma, but as far as history goes, it's highly interesting.

*The Strongest Tribe* - Iraqi Freedom

*Rise and Fall of the Third Reich* - WWII, Amazing read. It seems long, but tells a lot of the back story and  events lesser known.

*Biggest Brother* - WW2, if you've read Band of Brothers, this one is a biography of Major Dick Winters. 

*The Day We Almost Bombed Moscow: Allied War in Russia 1918-1920* - A little known part of history, highly recommend

*Danger Close* - Michael Yon is one of my favorite authors and I'd recommend all of his books.

*U.S. Navy Seawolves: The Elite HAL-3 Helicopter Squadron* - Fought hard in Vietnam and the book tells the gritty details.

*Bridge at Remagen* - WW2, small unit of Americans broke a major push by the Germans that likely would have changed the course of history.

**Edit:** I'd like to somewhat clarify that I'm looking for unbiased sources of the history of Illuminati conspiracy theories. I'm not interested in sources from proponents of these theories. 
Any resources would be greatly appreciated. ",history,1400340138,djaked,12,24,True,2014-05-17

It is believed that the genocide claimed as many as 100,000 victims between 1904 and 1907.","I've read today in my native language that Extermination camps were created and tested by German Empire few years before it happen in Europe. Wilhelm II Empire developed and tested a ""prototype"" of an Extermination camps 30 years earlier in Windhoek and Lüderitz, Namibia. It is believed that the genocide claimed as many as 100,000 victims between 1904 and 1907.

One of the big contributors to the crime - Franz von Epp - was later very close to the A. Hitler; He did help him to meet a number of very influential people at the beginning of Nazi party in Munich.

Namibia is located on South West coast of Africa. It is one of least populated countries of modern world - 2.54 people/km2. In comparison their south located neighbour - South Africa has 42.4 people/km2.

50,[meta] Moving forward as a default subreddit.,"It has been slightly over a week since the new set of default subreddits was announced, /r/history being one of them. Becoming a default presents a whole new set of challenges for a subreddit, all of the sudden you are faced with increased growth, more time in the spotlight and subscribers that did not made the conscious choice to subscribe to the specific subreddit. For example in the ten days since /r/History has become a default. We've already added over 100,000 new subscribers to the user base.
All of this can be very daunting and one of the immediate concerns voiced by many /r/history regulars was that the quality of the subreddit might suffer because of the default status. 

As the moderation team we share many of the concerns and have spend a considerable amount of time thinking about ways to keep /r/history's quality up and possibly even improve it in some areas. In this post we will outline what we have in mind for the future of this subreddit. Please take your time to read through it and ask about and discuss this post in the comments below. 


### 1. Clear rules in the sidebar.

One of the first thing we did once /r/history became a default is to make sure that there could be no mistake about what we expect from /r/history subscribers. 


### 2. New rules. 

We also did evaluate the current rules in place. We came to the conclusion that although enough for a smaller subreddit with a dedicated community they are fine but that for a default they would not be enough. However we also did not want to simply restrict and create a new set of rules that is a very long list of ""don't do this, don't do that"". It is something we couldn't entirely avoid but we have mainly focussed on supplementing the current rules with new rules that should encourage quality. 

- **Comments should be on-topic and contribute to the conversation in a meaningful way.**  
One of the most heard complaints about default subreddits is the fact that the comment section has a considerable amount of jokes, puns and other off topic comments. While this is perfectly fine for subreddits with a less serious nature, we do not think this is acceptable for /r/history. We are a dedicated subreddit to knowledge about a certain subject with an emphasis on discussion. Therefore we think it is no more than reasonable to ask from subscribers to comment with that in mind. 

- **No politics or soapboxing.**  
We're clarifying the no politics rule to be about soapboxing in general. /r/history is a place where history is discussed, not agendas hashed out. We want to make clear that just because a comment isn't explicitly political doesn't mean it's historical discourse.

- **When submitting link posts you should leave a comment about the submitted content.**   
We strongly feel that if you find something interesting enough to share on /r/history it should be no problem to leave a short comment (50 or more words) about what you submitted. This may be anything from why you thought this is relevant for /r/history to what you found interesting about what you have submitted. 
This comment left by the OP can best be seen as a kickstarter for discussion. If there is already a comment present people will be more inclined to respond about the subject resulting in more and on-topic discussion. 

- **Self Posts require a descriptive body text.**  
This rules is closely related to the one above it and the same principles apply here. When stating something or when asking for a question it should not be difficult to expand a bit about it. After all it is something you have a interest in. Doing so will ensure that people have more to start the discussion with, again leading to better and more discussion about the subject. 

- **This is an actively moderated subreddit, calls will be made at the moderator's discretion.**  
This rule is not in here because we plan to completely arbitrary remove things. If that were the case we would have left the sidebar empty and be done with it. Instead we actually spend a considerably amount on making clear rules and this rather long wall of text.  
In fact this rule is only here to leave no doubt about what is already implied for basically any online community. The world is not black and white, it is actually rather gray. So at times we might make calls to remove certain things that strictly speaking might have fitted our rules (albeit barely) based on personal judgement. 


### 3. How are you planning on implementing these rules?

Having a set of rules is nice, but they will only remain words unless we act on them. Below we have lined out how we plan to make sure that these rules are indeed followed. 

- **Active and dedicated moderators.**   
As some of you might have noticed /r/history has had a bunch of moderators added to the team. All of us are dedicated to history and have experience with history related subreddits all over reddit. The moderation team includes mods from /r/AskHistorians, /r/HistoryPorn and of course the oldtimers from /r/history itself! Because of this dedication and our shared belief that quality is something that comes out of effort and hard work we are not afraid to make our hands dirty. 

- **Automoderator use.**  
Automoderator is a powerful piece of software that these days is found in almost all subreddits that can perform a wide variety of actions based on various filters. It will be used to remove the most blatant violations of our rules and attend us to other cases for us to check it out. We mention this explicitly because we want to be open about the fact that we use it to aid us in managing this subreddit. As mentioned we have set it up with several rules and filters that we believe will help this remain clean and of higher quality. As with anything, if you believe something was removed in error, [please message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhistory) so we can have a look.

- **You the community member!**   
All the changes and vision we have presented in this post is based on the wish for quality made clear by a lot of the /r/history subscribers. If you want us to help us in maintaining this quality you easily can! Every comment and every post has a ""report"" button under it, use it to report rule breaking posts and comments and it will send us ping that we have to look into it. We will keep an active eye on the subreddit, however it is always possible you got there first or none of us happens to be online at the time the rule violation takes place. When reported these posts and comments will be the first to get out attention when we log in!. 


### 4. Weekly threads. 

We have addressed a lot in regards to rules, however we have also plans to actively promote discussion in other ways. One of these will be weekly threads about a wide variety of topics. We have several concepts being worked on in regards to these topics. These threads should provide a good entry point for everyone interested in history. 

### 5. Closing notes.

We will continuously keep looking at the state of the subreddit and adjust our approach accordingly. This means that rules might change in the future, new things will be tried and we will keep in touch with as the community. The latter we will do through posts like this but also through being active as community members ourselves. 

If you have questions for the moderators about something that was or was not removed, [please message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhistory).  And please as said before report anything you think is spam or inappropriate for /r/History and the mod team here will take a closer look at it.  ",history,1400427198,creesch,21,26,True,2014-05-18

I enjoyed the pieces relating perfume taste and uses to the biblical, historic, political and social history globally, as well as learning of perfumes interpretive meanings and symbolism. 

I was really bitten by the bug to learn more, and I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations as where to begin. I'm looking for an academic read, rather than casual. 

Also is anyone from /r/fragrance has any suggestions I'd be delighted to hear from them.

So far we have got some very positive reviews of the book.

It is his memoirs that tell the story if what he experienced at the start of ww2 as a 16 year old Polish boy that joined a partisan group to fight against the invading Russian army. It details his fighting and his arrest and brutal intorrgation by the Russians before being condemned to death and spending 23 days on death row. Amazingly he got his sentenced changed from death to 25 years hard labour in Siberia.

He and a group of prisoners managed to escape the train taking them to Siberia and he was the inly one of the group that managed to escape to Finland where he went to England. He later returned to occupied Europe as a member of the Special Operations Executive.

Its an amazing story and if you like war stories its worth reading!

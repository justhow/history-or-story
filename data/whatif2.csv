19,Would the Ottoman Empire have survived for longer had Osman II not been assassinated?,"Some background here: Osman II assumed the throne in 1618 at age 14 after a successful coup against his uncle, Sultan Mustafa. Though he only ruled for four years, Osman is said to have been an extremely literate and worldly ruler (he could supposedly speak Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, and Italian, among others). He also proved himself to be an assertive ruler in that he brokered peace treaties with the Safavids and personally led an invasion of Poland. After the latter turned out to be a disaster, Osman blamed the Janissaries for the failure of the campaign. 

This last part is where my interest in this question stems from. It's said that Osman wanted to disband the Janissaries (as Mahmud II would do two centuries later) and create a new army of ethnic Turks. As a result, he barred the Janissaries from their coffee shops, sparking an uprising that ended with his death. If he managed to suppress and disband the Janissaries and see his new army come to fruition, could we perhaps have seen the Ottomans win at Vienna some 60 years later?

This makes women wonder why they aren't guaranteed similar rights, and they begin demonstrating. The 15th Amendment to the US Constitution is still ratified in 1870, but this time it guarantees the same things as the 19th Amendment. Women have the vote 50 years early.

55,"Unique twist on ""What if the Nazi's got the bomb first?""","What if, instead of devoting all resources to militarizing and racking up a massive debt and creating an economic crisis that could only be stopped through conquest, Hitler decided to postpone the war for a few more years, while he secretly funded the Nazi Atomic bomb project, and invaded Poland and the USSR through a haze of nuclear firepower in the late 1940's. 

Basically, the Germany military would be way less equipped and funded and the German economy may not have been as strong, yet let's say in this timeline, Germany is able to produce around 25-30 atomic bombs by 1946, and avoided declaring war on anybody (neither has Japan, they just stuck to fighting China), so in 1945 you have a much stronger France and UK, yet a marginally stronger US (as they don't re-arm and could potentially remain in the depression/have low economic growth without military mobilization). 

The only wildcard in this scenario is the USSR: Are they stronger militarily in 1946 as OTL 1941, or do they focus more on their economy? Do they invade Germany preemptively in 1942-1943 and do they still invade Finland/Baltics/Romania/Poland and most importantly, does the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact still get inked without Germany setting its sights on Poland in 1939? 

The main question, which is up for as much interpretation as you want, is simply: What if Germany postponed World War II b(y not spending itself into an economic crisis) until 1946, when it had secretly produced 25-30 working atomic bombs (15-30kT each)?


EDIT: New angle to the question, since the above is a little too complicated and has too many variables: Germany somehow is able to secretly acquire 10 nukes by June 22 1941 (let's assume a number of scientific breakthroughs allow this to be possible) and can manufacture another 2-3 bombs per month for the rest of the war.

69,Could an American empire ever have been successfully created?,"To preface: I'm not asking whether the empire could have been held together for a substantial period or whether it would have been morally right to do so, just whether or not America could have hypothetically conquered the world at a certain point in time in the manner described below or any other.

My thinking is that the two best opportunities to do so would've been immediately after the fall of Berlin in 1945 or immediately after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

First, looking at the end of World War II. I'm not sure if this is urban legend or truth, but I've heard many times that immediately after he took Berlin Patton asked Truman whether or not he wanted him to march on Moscow, saying that the Soviets would not be our allies any longer. Whether or not Patton actually asked him that, I think considering the massive losses that the Russians had suffered and that the offensive would've started in early May meaning we wouldn't have been fighting in Russia in the winter, the Americans could have successfully taken Moscow in 1945. I know that we could never have been able to successfully annex Russia (for lack of a better term); the main point is that we would've kept there from being a massive centralized government that was diametrically opposed to America's interests. 

We also could have intervened on the side of the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War and set up a state friendly to America. Latin America was already within America's sphere of influence, as was Western Europe (and by extension Africa) in the years immediately after WWII. With the Soviet Union neutralized there would've been no real military threat to us, and in with the dropping of the A-bombs we could've cowed many other states into submission. Without the concerted and monumental efforts of the Soviet Union, it's unlikely that any other state could've successfully developed atomic weaponry for at least a couple decades, meaning America would've had a monopoly on that superweapon and could've used it essentially with impunity. 

Over the next couple of decades I see America dominating the planet either through setting up puppet states (what would happen in China), conquering and ruling outright (what would happen in Japan and Russia), or expanding economic, cultural, and military dominance to the extent that some countries, while ostensibly still independent states, would be virtual vassal states of America (what would happen in Western Europe and the some of the Americas). 

As for expanding in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union, I think it'd be harder just because other states have the bomb, there's a much more powerful China, and the economies of Europe are just as strong if not stronger than America's. In terms of military might, however, I think America could've still had a shot at setting up a puppet state in the weakened Russia and potentially moved into China as well, who still hadn't reached the heights they have today, for instance. Hopefully economic interests and unwillingness to commit to total war would've kept most other countries out of war against America.

Again, I know that it would've been immensely difficult to actually hold such an empire together, terrorism would have become commonplace, and the administrative and military costs associated with maintaining it would have been astronomical. Basically I'm asking if the scenarios described above would have been possible and viable, or if there has ever been a better scenario for America to essentially come to militarily dominate the entire world to the extent that it could be considered an empire?",HistoricalWhatIf,1368054792,quantumshenanigans,54,78,True,2013-05-08

The army was receptive to his talk of revenge against Germany. He had even managed to get the far Left to support. In fact, he was drawing support from everybody that didn't like democracy due to the way that they could all read whatever they wanted into his rhetoric due to its lack of solid promises.

Despite being fairly anti-democratic he was winning seats in parliament that he was not even a candidate for. The time looked right. His supporters rose up, all it would take was an appearance from the General to start a revolution which could have propelled him to absolute power ... and he blew it. He decided to wait for the elections hoping to gain power legitimately, but by that time the status quo had seen the danger that he represented and done what they could to sabotage his chances.

In reality, Díaz decided that he was not going to retire but rather allow Francisco Madero, an aristocratic but democratically leaning reformer, to run against him. Although Madero, a landowner, was very similar to Díaz in his ideology, he hoped for other elites in Mexico to rule alongside the president. Ultimately, however, Díaz did not approve of Madero and had him jailed during the election in 1910. Despite what he had formerly said about democracy and change, sameness seemed to be the only reality.

What if Diaz allowed free elections and Mexico became a prosperous, democratic nation in 1910? What would have been the implications for WW1 (Zimmerman Telegram),  WW2 and especially the Cold War. 

Assuming Mexico's population in this alternate timeline would be the same as today (due to a lower birthrate but also a lower emigration rate), and it was as wealthy as Canada, its GDP would be about $4.6T making it the 4th or 5th largest economy in the world.

4,What if Saladin butchered the Christians in the sack of Jerusalem?,"When Jerusalem capitulated to Saladin in 1187, he gave the Frankish inhabitants passage back to Christian lands - despite the fact that the Christians who had taken Jerusalem in the first place had slaughtered the inhabitants. 

Saladin even demanded a crazy-low ransom for the Frankish people of Jerusalem (about fifty bucks a person in today's money), as I understand it. While several thousand were still enslaved, I'm under the impression that the terms Saladin gave to Jerusalem were pretty generous. 

(Admittedly, these terms weren't reached until Balian of Ibelin - Orlando Bloom in *Kingdom of Heaven* - threatened to kill 5000 Muslim hostages and start tearing down holy sites while they holed up against the siege.)

I've also heard, though I can't find a cite at the moment, that Saladin refrained from desecrating Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, choosing notably to pray in a building next door to a church rather than converting the church itself to a mosque.

All in all, it seems like Saladin was pretty lenient in his sack of Jerusalem. I won't guess at his motives, but the results were clear: Richard the Lionheart used the ""Saladin tithe"" to finance the Third Crusade, sacked Acre, and executed 3000 Muslim prisoners. The Crusade, of course, failed to retake Jerusalem. Richard and Saladin later agreed on the Treaty of Ramla, and so on and so forth.

My question is this: Regardless of his motivation, what was the true effect of Saladin's leniency? What if he had taken Jerusalem in the same ultraviolent fashion it had been taken from the Muslims, instead of giving the Franks safe passage to Christian lands? Would he have broken his army against the renewed resistance of a Jerusalem now fighting to the death? Would Richard's crusade have been successful against Saladin's weakened forces?

44,What if the US was much more powerful than is today?,"I really enjoy what if senarios where an existing trend is taken to it's furthest extreme.  One of these senarios is imagining how the world would be the US was even more powerful than it is now.  

How would this be accomplished?

A)  **Make Canada warmer:**  This is done by making the Hudson Bay deeper  and cutting off its connection with the artic ocean through the Foxe Basin.  As a result, the bay doesn't freeze over in the winter.  The area around the bay becomes warmer and capable of hosting a much larger population, has a more productive climate (Churchill has a similar temperature to say, St. Petersberg or Stockholm), is capable of hosting year round deep water shipping, ect.  The rest of Canada also becomes warmer, with the treeline going north, the northern parts of Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec becoming more productive economic areas.  Essentially, Canada becomes a second Russia of sorts.  

B)  **The US controls Canada:**  As in OTL, the French cononize Quebec, the British colonize the Hudson Bay and the original US and the British eventually take Quebec from France.  However, this time, the British don't enact the Quebec act, resulting in Quebec joining the United States.  Of course, the British still control the Hudson bay but the border is disputed (I'm basing this off the Oregon Boundary Dispute) and in the 1840s there is a war which the US wins.  So it ends up controlling the (warmer and ice free) Hudson bay and the rest of Canada  (Alternatively, the US might manage to purchase the rest of Canada from the British).

Alaska however, is not bought up by Stewart in the 1867, which I figured would make things more interesting.  Perhaps Alaska joins the US later (ex: During the Russian Revolution or the breakup of the USSR) but I'll leave that up to you guys. 

The Hudson bay becomes an economic area similar to the Great Lakes region today only larger.  There's much more farmland and more productive land in general and more immigrants (perhaps more Chinese imigrants are let in) massively increasing the total US population. 

C)  **The Southwestern United States** is taken in a manner similar to OTL only the US decides to annex all of Mexico after the Mexican American War.

So by 1900, the US controls ALL of North America except for Alaska, has a much larger and more diverse popluation, much more productive land and a warmer climate.

What does the world look like today?  How does US history (ex: the civil war) play out?  Does the US in this senario become too large to hold together into one country?  What do US politics look like?  How much more powerful is the US really?

Instead of marching on the strange land of India, he decides to march from [Alexandria the Furthest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Eschate), through the [Fergana Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergana_Valley), into the [Tarim Basin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarim_Basin).

There he'll find an inhospitable desert and hostile nomads - nothing he hasn't dealt with before. However, he'll also find a series of oases that serve as the cradle for small, emerging kingdoms such as Kashgar and Shanshan. These kingdoms are the beginnings of the legendary Silk Road, although no one really knows that yet. So far, they're just stopping points for nomads who cross the desert to trade with one and other.

Will Alexander be able to conquer anything in this situation?

If they do still come about, they'd tear across Northern Africa, come up through Spain, but there'd be no Christians to hold them off for centuries. They'd likely meet up with Germanic peoples or Celts.

Whoever won out between them for control of Europe would determine the dominant religion of much of the world, assuming the Age of Exploration goes off as it did, which i think it would, since both Muslims and Vikings were given to sailing around spreading their respective lifestyles.

Even so, I wonder if a stronger Empire would have been less exhausted at the end of Heraclius's war with the Sassanids, and might therefore have fared better when the Arab invasions began.  Of course, some of the problems would still have been in place - in particular, the dissension created by the Empire's persecution of religious minorities.  But I still wonder if they could perhaps have held more territory than they did in real history.  What does Spanish history end up looking like if no Islamic empire ever materializes in North Africa?  Might be worth a thread in and of itself.

And if the Byzantines win far more than they actually did, and arrive in the mid-13th century with their power and wealth intact, what would this mean for relations with the Mongols?  Would a wealthy Empire prove too tempting a target for the Hordes to pass up?

Constantinople itself might prove a tough, but not necessarily impossible, nut to crack.  Other territories would have been far more vulnerable, and given the defeats suffered by the Chinese and the Arabs, I'm skeptical of the ability of even a strong Byzantine army to hold off a Mongolian attack.

(I know this is a duplicate, see description)","I saw this idea was posted a couple of days ago, wrote up this response, [posted it on my blog](http://alternatehistoryinquirer.blogspot.com/2013/03/islam-and-christianity-switch-places.html), and then couldn't find the original thread. I'll be damned if I don't post it now though, so here it is. Please pick it apart, or maybe even expand on it...

&gt;What if Islam and Christianity switched places geographically, with Muslims in western Europe and Christians in the eastern Mediterranean region, what we today think of as the ""Middle East."" While this might seem far fetched at first glance, it is actually historically quite plausible.

&gt;Remember Christianity was founded in the east, in the Roman province of Judea. On the eve of the Arab invasions, the Roman Empire, which by the 7th century was mostly the eastern empire with a few holdings in Italy and Spain, sponsored what would become the Catholic church. The Germanic rulers of western Europe on the other hand predominantly followed the Arian heresy.

&gt;Next consider the Muslim invasions, events as transformative as they were unlikely. Arguably the only reason tribesmen from the backwater of Arabia managed to conquer most of the western world was the epic war which the two main powers of the time, the Roman (or ""Byzantine"") Empire and Sassanid Persia, fought from 602 through 628. That war thoroughly exhausted both sides in terms of money, infrastructure, and personnel, allowing the Arabs to sweep through both empires just a few years later.

&gt;Removing that Byzantine-Sassanid War is the key to meddling with the geographic placement of Christianity and Islam. So how can that be done? First, we must examine why the war happened in the first place. Up until 602, the emperors of Rome and Persia, Maurice and Khosrau II respectively, were on very good terms. Maurice had rescued Khrosau II from a rebellion a decade earlier, for which Khosrau owed him gratitude. So when Maurice was assassinated by his troops in the winter of 602 for ordering them to winter north of the Danube River, which meant exposing them to attack by invading Slavs and Avars, Khosrau did not hesitate to attack.

&gt;Let's say Maurice chose not to push his troops and allowed them to winter in friendly territory. Then for the next three decades, a state of relative peace is maintained between Rome and Persia. Maurice is succeeded by his son and co-emperor Theodosius and things are fine and dandy until the 630s, when, as in our timeline, the Muslims invade.

&gt;The Muslim armies were led by a strategical genius named Khalid ibn Al-Whalid. Al-Whalid, reading the different situation, likely would not have attempted to invade Rome and Persia simultaneously. I could come up with any number of justifications for invading Rome first, but to save time let us just assume he decides to head west first. Arab armies, not overstretched as one might argue they were in our timeline, still manage to defeat Roman forces which are more lively then in our timeline. The Levant and Syria fall in 637 and Egypt falls in 639.

&gt;But rather then rapidly expanding from this position, war with Rome and the effort of pacifying the newly conquered peoples is enough to keep the Muslims bottled up in this area. Attempts to invade Persia are beaten off by Khosrau and then his successor. But perhaps a decade later, the mass of Arab tribesmen, much more concentrated here than in our timeline, conquer North Africa. A few decades later they cross the Straights of Gibralter, conquering the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain, then storming across the Pyrenees to beat the Franks into submission before turning south to sack Rome itself.

&gt;All this might seem far fetched, but remember the resources which were expended in Persia are free in this timeline, those extra Arab tribesmen itching for their own land to rule. But I imagine sacking Rome would have been a step too far for our ambitious Arabs. Such a move would likely have sparked a revolt in their eastern territories of Syria, the Levant, and Egypt. With all of their armies in Western Europe, such a revolt would have been successful. Rather than returning to the fold of Constantinople the Copts of Egypt would likely have created their own kingdom. They had long been ostracized by Constantinople for following Miaphyisitism, a Christian sect deemed a heresy nearly 200 years prior to the Arab invasions.

&gt;With refugees from the east to bolster their armies in Western Europe, the Muslims certainly would have been able to hang onto Spain and Gaul along with North Africa. A full conquest of Italy also seems likely, as a Byzantium without Egypt would be in total crisis mode, struggling to feed Constantinople, much less regain loss territories to the East. So there you have it, Western Europe and western North Africa is eventually Islamicized. The Christianization of Anglo-Saxon Britain is in doubt, with missionaries coming only from Christian Ireland and the Brittons in the west. Whether Britain too would eventually become Muslim, or if the Anglo-Saxon Gods could hold on is anyone's guess.

&gt;In the East, Christianity reigns supreme in Egypt, in Anatolia, and in the Balkans, as well as in Ethiopian, which was the first country to convert to Christianity. The Arabian Peninsula is still a Muslim holdout, and likely to remain so, so long as the western Muslims continue the Hajj to Mecca and Medina. In Persia the state religion is still Zoroastrianism, though Manichaeism (a new religion drawing from Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Buddhism) could still supplant Ahura Mazda.",HistoricalWhatIf,1363137323,Yelnoc,3,4,True,2013-03-12

55,Could World War One have been win or at least shortened if modern tactics had been used on the battlefield?,"I am currently reading a history of the First World War and it strikes me (possibly due to the writer harping on it quite a bit) that the formations used by the infantry were little better than those Napoleon used a hundred years before; soldiers were trained to stay in (relatively) tight formations and use wave after wave off assaults to break through to hand to hand combat.

If tactics used today, or merely thirty years later during the Second World War, were individual movement and smaller scale tactics are employed at the start of the war, could the war have been won earlier? Or was the technology limited enough that this was actually the most effective way to fight? I know communications were still through shouts, trumpets, banners, etc during the battles, as radio was still a while off, and coordination between units and supporting artillery was lacking. Also there were no tanks and few aircraft in 1914 to help break the defenses of the enemy. But perhaps I'm trying to answer my own question.

It also did not help when Wilson got sick during the peace talks, allowing the French leader Clemenceau to take charge of the peace negotiations. Clemenceau wanted Germany to pay for the war, while Wilson wanted to take a more lenient policy.

I'm curious what a modern athlete of his caliber could accomplish in the ancient world, lets say Rome, or Gaul, or Germainia, or Caledonia, something along those lines.  Were there athletes of that size/speed in those days?  I'm sure there were some barbarians of his stature but I don't know much about that time period.

Many of the great physicists of the 20-30's were germans and austrians, who fled as soon as the anti-semite rethoric became stronger and the nazis ascended to power. While nazism is always thought as almost a synonim with the holocaust, fascism not necessarily is. Italy who created fascism, never created the violent killing machine the germans where known for.

So suppose that antisemitism in nazi germany remains at the italian level, about the same level that racism was in the United States in the 30's: jews have to deal with prejudice on their everyday lives, but aren't persecuted.

The Ottomans lose 20 ships trying to go through the Cape of Good Hope, and manage to reach the Indian Ocean with 580 ships. The sailors are tired of a four months of travel due to storms and harassment by Coalition naval forces. 

**January 1551**-The Union of Kalamar has invaded Saxony and managed to wipe out the Saxon navy at the battle of Meldor. The Scandinavians push further into the interior of the Duchy, with 30,000 infantry 1,000 cavalry and a 100 cannons which overrun the feeble 15,000 infantry and 30 cannons the Duchy and her German allies mustered. By the end of January, Saxony is safely in Coalition hands and the coalition prepares an invasion of Bavaria with the 26,000 remaining infantry, 9,000 cavalry, and 100 cannons.

**March 1551**-The Spanish have amassed an armada for an invasion of Britain. The Spanish amass a fleet of 20,000 warships and enter the English Channel for war. The British have devoted their war effort to amassing a strong fleet and with the Scandinavians finished in Germany they are able to lend 5,000 warships added to the British 23,000 warships putting them at an advantage. The both sides meet at the Channel and the British naval force barely manages to win. The British navy has destroyed the Spanish naval force and assert dominance over the Atlantic.

**April 1551**-The Safavids, even with reinforcements, loose ground on both sides. The Ottomans have defeated them at the battle of Isfahan and the Chagtai continue to move south, the Safavids decide to make their last stand at Shiraz and a force of 5,000 Safavids and 10,000 Ethiopians make their stand against a 30,000 man army from the Ottomans. The Ottomans call back their artillery and cavalry to prepare for the defense of Austria. The battle ends with a stunning victory for the Ottomans and a complete defeat of the Safavids. 5,000 Ethiopians and 1,000 Safavid troops, along with the royal family, escape to Ethiopia.

**June 1551**-The French have decided to take action in the Holy Roman Empire and send a massive army into Saxony to oppose the Scandinavians. The French annex Lorraine and move 40,000 troops, 10,000 cavalry, and 1,000 cannons but resistance from Lorraine forces them to leave 5,000 to pacify the kingdom. The Scandinavians and French meet at Lippe River in southern Saxony and fight for control of Germany. The Scandinavians loose, and retreat to Emus river and set up a line of defense there.

**December 1551**-A Bavarian fighting force prepares for an invasion of the Papal States and amass a force of 20,000 Ottomans and Bavarian infantry, 1,000 mainly Ottoman cavalry and 500 Ottoman cannons. They cross the Adriatic and land at Ancona and easily overrun the city. By the end of the year they have control of all lands to the east of Perugia and Spolento.

**January 1552**-French spies discover that the Duchy of Savoy and Republic of Genoa plan a joint invasion of Morocco to cut off Ottoman supply lines to the east. The French navy manages to intercept them off the coast of Algeria and with their 20,000 ship strong armada manage to destroy the 8,000 strong invasionary force. Right after this, due to a stalemate in Germany, the French invade Genoa and Savoy. The lightning quick French army takes Genoa in 3 weeks and finishes off mainland Genoa in a week; leaving Genoese Corsica as the only remaining part of their empire.

**March 1552**-The Ethiopians know they cannot face the Ottomans in a large naval battle after suffering large losses in Persia, so they decide to open a new front at the heart of the Ottoman Empire: Egypt. The Ethiopians had known the source of the Nile for over a thousand years, and the Ottomans never bothered to find the source so they have the element of surprise. Thus, a flotilla containing 30,000 troops (the bulk of the Ethiopian army), 3,000 cavalry, and 1,000 newly acquired cannons from Britain; sails up the Nile and manages to sail up the Nile and take two key cities: Alexandria and Cairo; and they manage to take control of the Siani.

45,WhatIf Discussion: How Hitler Could Have Won or Prolonged World War 2,"There are a few posts/comments and discussions about this, so I thought I'd put together a list of things that could have been done. Given that 90% of my WhatIf replies involve World War 2 in some way, I figured that I would fire the first shot on trying to organize something.

*But before I begin to list something very lengthy, a few notes*:

1. Hitler is arguably the prime target of WhatIf changes, as he made most of the blunders during the war in regards to strategic objectives. Time and time again, he made errors that cost the Germans heavily.

2. Assuming that the major players get involved in the war, I don't see how Germany wins. In any WhatIf scenario, the United States is essentially the lynchpin of German failure - if they enter the war, its very precarious that Germany could win, given what America brought to the war (primarily the fact that the US was barely touched during the war, and could throw whatever it wanted at the war effort). 

3. Even assuming that there are major changes made in the war, there is no acertainable way to determine how they effect other conflicts. From what I've read about World War Two (not that I've read a lot - maybe in the low thousands of hours in reading books, Wikipedia, or documentaries on the war), one should always note that battles and decisions run together, and every change in outcome leads to another battle, and possible failure of leadership on any side of the discussion. So assuming that a WhatIf scenario occurs may not cause a decicive victory by the Germans.

With this being said, here are a few WhatIf's of my own. Feel free to add to this:



**Event #1: Dunkirk**

The [Dunkirk Evacuation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation) in May-June 1940 is one of the most brilliant and successful logistical operations in the history of war. As the British Expeditionary Forces and French remnants were driven back by the Germans, they had few places to go - Dunkirk one of them. Thanks to the evacuation, 339,000 troops were able to flee to Britian, which bolstered both morale and troop levels in Britain (which in turn allowed them to re-deploy forces to North Africa, and later on, the Normandy Invasion). 

Although Hitler is argued as being the person that stopped the German advance, AFAIK, the responsibility lies more on [von Rundstedt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Rundstedt), with Hitler agreeing with him later. The Germans may have been able to press the French rearguard action, resulting in major Allied losses. I'm unsure if they could have fully decimated the fleeing soldiers, but any loss of allied soldiers here would have had a huge impact on the war.

The result of an unsuccessful Dunkirk evacuation could have been far reaching. The Italians could have had a more successful North African campaign, D-Day may not have seen as many veteran British soldiers seeing action, and on the most extreme example - Britain may have sued for peace. At any rate, its a major German blunder. 



**Event #2: The Yugoslavian Invasion**

The [Invasion of Yugoslavia](http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_invasion_of_Yugoslavia) was one of Hitler's most brilliant tactical successes. The war only lasted a few days. However, the battle only began at the conclusion of hostilities. The Yugoslavian people resisted Hitler furiously throughout the war, becoming a constant drain on Germany until they were liberated. Honestly, I can't wrap my head around why they invaded: As far as I know, it had little strategic value, other than being arguably on the allies side - it didn't contain strategic resources like Hungary or Romania did. 

Additionally, due to partisan activities, Operation Barbarossa was postponed, which may have hampered the German war against the USSR. I can't put a lot of stock into how radically the lack of an invasion would have changed the war, but I do think that in order for the Germans to win, they have to be focused on the USSR and other major powers. 


**Event #3: Operation Barbarossa**

Covering various things to make Barbarossa run better than it did is a huge task. A lot of it went well - the Soviets were caught by total surprise, and the Germans ran roughshod over the Soviets up until winter set in. However, there are a few over-arching objectives and decisions Germany made that cost them a lot of huge issues.

In my opinion, the following things would have helped them immensely to achieve greater tactical success against the Soviets:

- *Greater emphasis on capturing Moscow.* [Army Group Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Group_Centre) was the spearhead for attacking Moscow. It contained 49 divisions, the most of any German Army Group. As we mostly know, it failed to take Moscow in a timely manner, as environmental concerns hampered their lightening advance (as well as delays in the Barbarossa itself). 

Given what we know after the war, Moscow was the most important objective in the Eastern War, as taking the city would have cut off lend-lease aid that poured into Arkangel'tsk, which was then shipped to Moscow - the same can be said of supplies from the interior. Without alternate routes by rail, the Soviet war effort would have been severely disrupted. 

- *Less emphasis on Stalingrad/Astrakhan*. The stated goal of the German war effort was to push the USSR to the A-A line, which was Arkangel'tsk to Astrakhan. If they achieved that, the Soviet Union would have most every major city under German control. However, this proved horrific for the Germans thanks to [Stalingrad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad). Had Army Group South have pushed further south into the Caucus Oil Fields, they may have been able to disrupt Soviet gas and oil supplies more than they did - although the Soviets had begun to re-focus their production further east due to fear of capture. Obviously Stalingrad is an issue a year later than Barbarossa, I am sure that more emphasis further south may have had better effect.

- *Ukrainian Partisans*. The Nazis committed a lot of war atrocities. They came back to bite them in the end, as they destroyed a lot of manpower that wasn't loyal to the USSR. And if there was one thing the Nazis really needed against the Soviets, it was more manpower. In most battles after '41, the Soviets outnumbered the Axis powers 2:1, 3:1, and more. Adding Ukrainians would have been huge for the Germans, with many not sharing love for the Soviets.


**Event 4: American Intervention**

As I stated at the start, if America gets involved against the Axis, its over. Although there is no easy way to get rid of American Lend-Lease aid, its only a fraction of Germany's concern. Once Americans started bombing German strategic targets, disrupting output had disastrous effects. As the war raged on, the Germans fought against ever-increasing disparity against the Soviets and others. 

Even if American intervention is unavoidable, if the Germans could have at least prolonged it, they would have had a better chance of survival. The easiest way I can see this happening is for the Germans to have totally disowned the Japanese prior to Pearl Harbor. If they could distance themselves, and restrain U-Boat warfare against American convoys, it could have delayed entry into the war, giving the Germans more favorable footing. 


**Other Considerations**

Another consideration (among the many others) is the German economy, and total economic mobilization. One major issue is that the Allied nations were willing to throw their women and children into the war factories, to produce weapons. Kids in the Soviet Union manufactured machine guns like the [PPsh-43](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPSh-43), while Rosie the Riveter build things like the [B-29 Superfortress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-29_Superfortress) - the most expensive R&amp;D project of the war (for the US, at least). 

German weaponry in World War 2 was incredibly good. It was not superior to Allied equipment in every facet, but they had a lot of weapons that were better, especially later in the war like the [Tiger I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I) and [Panther](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panther_tank) tanks, the [Me-262 Fighter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me-262), and the [MG-42](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG-42) among other weapons. Despite their superiority, between their complexity and German aversion to using lesser people to build the weaponry, it meant that these superior weapons were churned out in terrible numbers. Had the Germans of been able to create more of these weapons - especially later models - it would have prolonged the war immensely.

(b) WAR CRIMES: namely, violations of the laws or customs of war.

(c)CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY: namely, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war; or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.

September-December 1529- The siege begins as Suleiman is able to bring these lightweight cannons to the Austrian's doorstep and use it to rain fire on their ramparts. The Austrians are able to fight valiantly for months however the sheer number and never-give-up attitude of Suleiman carry the Ottomans through the day as they are able to conquer the city and bring the Hapsburg Empire to its knees.

**January 1530**- Suleiman spends a month in the city working out the terms of surrender of the Hapsburgs and they concede all of Austria to the Ottomans provided they make no attempt to invade Spain or any Hapsburg holdings to the west of Austria. Suleiman agrees, however many within his camp, including his son, plead him to continue to march west. Meanwhile in France, the French government is ecstatic that the Hapsburgs have been significantly weakened and no longer threaten compete with them in the east.

**March 1535**-Suleiman had traveled back to Constantinople and ushered in a new golden age of the Ottoman Empire as the Ottomans have been able to gain new wealth by supplying the Western Europeans with strong Eastern European lumber for their trading ships. Suleiman sees the world is changing and also builds a strong navy and asserts himself in a new Atlantic trade.

**August 1535**-The French have been able to defeat a now crippled Hapsburg Empire at the Battle of Cagliari and extract concessions in the form of New World colonies from Hapsburg Spain, particularly the territories of Peru and Rio de La Plata (parts of OTL Peru, Argentina, and Uruguay, Chile and parts of Brazil,) and the French assume direct control of the shipping and mining of precious metals in the New World

Maybe Aizu never occupied Kyoto and alienated their Satsuma allies? Then the Choshu rebellion would be more isolated and the Tosa domain wouldn't feel threatened into joining the imperialists by the power of the SatCho alliance. That could be a death sentence to the militant imperialist faction, but I don't know the Bakumatsu well enough to assume that's correct.

Anyway, for whatever reason, imperialist rebellions are defeated, most domains remain loyal to the Tokugawa Shogunate, the Boshin War never gets off the ground, and there is no Meiji Restoration. This would leave only the more reactionary and moderate political factions with any power.

 * How would the Shogunate develop politically? Even before the major rebellions there was a lot of talk about reorganizing the government. How would the Shogunate reform to meet the challenges of an increasingly interconnected 19th century world? Would domains and daimyo still have a place, or would the be swept away as they were historically?

 * Along that note, how would Japan develop economically under the Shogunate? Would it liberalize? Would it be able to compete with European powers as the Empire of Japan did historically?

 * Would the Shogunal army be anything comparable to the historical Imperial army? Would the Samurai class retain some of its privileges?

I was thinking of perhaps having a democrat win the presidential election in 1988 in the United States, this president is much more afraid of a possible Vietnam-like scenario and so doesn't put a military option on the table when it comes to ousting Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  There would still be sanctions (which would probably drive up the price of oil) and diplomatic wrist slapping but Iraqi forces would be quite secure in their control of Kuwait.

So what happens now? Iraq now controls something like 10% of the world's oil production.  Iran and Saudi Arabia are probably worried about Iraq coming after them next.

35,"What if Louis Napoleon, Prince Imperial, survives the Zulu War","At 9 AM of 1st of June, 1879, Lt. Jaheel Carey of the 98th Foot, Sergeant Robert Willis, Corporal Grubb, Troopers Le Tocq, Abel, Cochrane and Rogers of the Natal Horse, and an anonymous African guide depart Lord Chelmsford's camp on a scouting expedition. With them is the last hope of the French Bonapartists: Louis Napoleon, Prince Imperial

Ostensibly, Napoleon journeyed to South Africa in order to see action on the battlefield and experience first hand the privations of a soldier. However, his motives were also political: The Republicans had gained an ascendancy in France for the first time since the demise of Napoleon III. Nonetheless, the political system in France was far from stable, with the Imperialists remaining ever-hopeful of ushering in a Third Empire. 

By about 3pm, the scouting party reaches an abandoned *kraal*, and the Prince, though he was technically unauthorized to do so, gives the order to dismount and stop for coffee. At around 3:50, Napoleon gives the order to mount, when an explosion of musketry announces the arrival of forty Zulus, running towards the party and screaming fearsomely. Most of the troopers gain their saddles (with the exception of poor Trooper Rogers, who loses his horse. He flees to a nearby hut where he, presumably, is later killed), and their mounts carry them away. Trooper Abel is struck in the back and falls from his horse, while Trooper Le Tocq lies across his saddle, unable to get his feet in the stirrups. But, four of the escort and Lieutenant Carey have escaped.

But what of the Prince Imperial? When mounting his horse shies. It appears, for a moment, that it will dash off, but the Prince leaps on the saddle and bolts after his remaining escort. 

What now? The heir to the throne of Imperial France is alive and well. Lusting for military glory, presumably he participates (as much as Chelmsford will allow) in the battle of Ulundi a month later, witnessing the destruction of the Zulu nation. But what them? Returning to Europe a hero, does he stand any chance of regaining the title of his father and great-uncle? Does Louis Napoleon become Napoleon IV, Emperor of the French?

Maybe there where a string of germanophile presidents, maybe all the German immigrants refused to learn English, the cause doesn't matter, only the effects. Just suppose that by the third quarter of the 1800s German is the number one language of the average American, with English dying out gradually as German did in OTL.

Given the burst of German industry and particularly science in the second half of the 19th century, would this have been advantageous for Germany, or a hindrance? Would a common language facilitate cross-cultural research and growth, or would the US have acted as a sink, draining up all those great German scientists, leaving Germany at a loss?

Would a new language influence the political posture of the US? Would they be more inclined towards Germany as a father nation? Or would realpolitik have rendered such romantic notions obsolete? How would this have affected the alliance system of the pre-war era? Would the new language expose the American people more readily to the new political ideologies and dogmas coming out from philosophers of German origin that they would only have seen as translations of possibly dubious quality before, which might have been easier to misrepresent and censor? 

And conversely, how would the lack of English affect them? Would the UK take a different stance, afraid of German dominance? Would the average American lose out on much English literature, engineering or scientific developments due to the disconnect from the worlds foremost economic and military power at that time?

I know that is question is improbable so let us build a little alternate history to surround this silly world in. Henry Ford is never able to mass manufacture the Model-T and never applies the assembly line idea to automobile construction (and for some reason no one else does either) cars remain a luxury item for the rich. 

Levittown and the first post-WWII mass production suburbs never happen either or if they do it is without a focus on the automobile (again suspend disbelief that no one could come up with this) therefore no huge exodus from the cities to the suburbs requiring cars as the primary mode of transportation to and from the cities to the suburbs.

One final caveat, because cars are not popularized the government does not believe investment in a national highway/freeway system is economically feasable even for defense purposes, and they do not get put in place.

Regardless of the silliness I demand you suspend disbelief about the cars not rising to power. You can ignore the hypothetical nature of this question and say: ""hurr hurr hurr that would never happen blah blah blah"" for all my other points, but I am afraid I must insist on the car aspect.

47,What if the U.S. had developed a strong presence in Africa via Liberia?,"The American Colonization Society established a U.S. colony in Liberia in hopes of repatriating free blacks back to Africa. From 1821 to 1847, when Liberia gained independence blacks that established themselves there were considered part of the ""Americo-Liberian"" ruling class. The U.S maintained relatively strong diplomatic and trade ties with the country but never fully developed its foothold there the way European nations did. 

What if the U.S had kept and developed a strong colonial presence in Liberia?

In response to the strong British presence in neighboring Sierra Leone, the US establishes a number of major ports, townships and military installations along the coast. 

With the obvious southern distaste for any notion of African settlement, scores of impoverished and discriminated Irish immigrants from the Northern U.S migrate to the colony establishing themselves in a virgin economy. The Great Famine in 1845 drives Irish immigration to the colony. 

The racial/class make up of the nation might resemble nineteenth century New Orleans: Whites, American-blacks, and indigenous Africans, with all sorts of combinations as well. 

When the Industrial Revolution is in full swing the vast Liberian iron ore deposits are found and developed. Vast rubber plantations are created. 

Liberia remains a pro-Union territory during the run-up to the Civil War. Giving the North a major strategic advantage in strangling Southern trade with Europe during the war, Liberia is granted statehood after the war. The end of slavery in the continental U.S sees a mass exodus of blacks from the South to the North and to Liberia. President Grant formulates the Grant Doctrine which calls for expansionism on the African continent; the heir of Manifest Destiny. 

Liberia benefits from each wave of immigration from Europe  to the United States. The establishment of American institutions in business, culture, and education means that Liberia is a model of liberal democracy in otherwise colonial Africa. A university is founded in Monrovia, in response to the British Fourrah Bay College in Sierra Leone, and Monrovia takes the distinction of being called the ""Athens of Africa"". 

Outside of major port centers the racial problem is serious. There are longstanding animosities between Whites, Americos, and indigenous Africans. The displacement of millions of indigenous Africans fosters tension. Minor rebellions are answered with overwhelming punishment by the government. It is this tension that leads to the opening salvos of the Civil Rights Movement which spreads across the ocean to the U.S.

Thus, in the 420's both Rome and Carthage have vested interests in Sicily. Likewise, the rising naval power of Athens has emerged from the first half of the Peloponnesian War and is looking for a region where it could gain an upper hand against the Spartan led Peloponnesian League. 

In OTL, the Sicilian Expedition (415 BC) happened almost exactly 150 years before the First Punic War (264 BC OTL, 414 altered timeline), a war which centered around the island of Sicily. The city of Syracuse maintained independence both times, interestingly. 

Any thoughts on the outcome? Alliances?

19,Princip chokes on his sandwich,"As we all know, an initial assassination attempt on Franz Ferdinand failed, and it was only through the intervention of a vengeful demiurge that his car passed the cafe where a crestfallen Gavrilo Princip was attempting to enjoy a sandwich. Now, imagine that that never happened, and the Archduke somehow made it back to Vienna. How would the world have changed in the following decades? It seems to me that there would still have been a number of incipient crises that could have led to a war. I'll throw out some ideas for the sake of speculation. 

**The German Navy**
The Second Reich was hungry for colonial possessions and was building a fleet to match the Royal Navy. Would they have been able to surpass it, and, if so, when, and what would have happened? At what point does a fleet-in-being need to become a fleet-in-doing?

**The Triple Monarchy**
It's believed (by which I mean I read it somewhere) that it Ferdinand had survived, he would have tried to pacify the Slavic population of the Empire by granting autonomy to the Serbo-Croatian areas (and possibly other Slavic areas) and forming an Austro-Slavo-Hungarian Triple Monarchy. Would this have been been enough for the bulk of the nationalists, or would it have only succeeded in pissing off the Hungarians, too? 

**Russian Industry**
The German leadership was very nervous about projected Russian economic growth -- they thought that it would surpass that of Germany and Austria combined within a few decades and smother their continental hegemony in its cradle. Would they have tried to force a war before the Russians could become unstoppable? 

**Autocracy, Orthodoxy, Nationality**
Assuming that Nicolas outlived Alexei, the crown would have passed to Olga, right? Would she have tried to maintain the policies of her father and grandfather in the face of profound popular discontent? How would it have ended? Could a female monarch have succeeded in introducing fundamental reforms in such an entrenched aristocratic system?

**Irredentia**
The Italians would have still had their eyes on Tyrol and Trieste, but they could never have defeated the German countries alone. How long would they have waited to make their move?

**The Pashas**
The only problem with the Turkification policies in the Ottoman Empire was that Anatolia was full of minorities and no one anywhere else was Turkish. Could the Empire have held together? Would it have faced a succession of military coups? Would the Russians have started a new ""short, victorious war"" to stifle dissent and conquer the Armenian areas, and how would the world have reacted? What would have been the effects of the exploitation of Iraqi oil?

**Elan**
The French would never have stopped plotting to take Alsace-Lorraine back. Would they have precipitated some crisis in which the Germans seemed to be the aggressors once the Russians looked strong enough in the East?

**Japan**
The Japanese wanted a colonial empire but would have had no hope of  taking one if Europe had remained at peace. Would they have tried anyway? Otherwise, how would stifled Japanese militarism have played out?

**World Socialism**
The influence of leftist ideologies like anarchism, socialism, and syndicalism was growing rapidly before WWI. Without the Soviet Union,  how would a the diffuse left-wing movements have continued to develop? Would there have been a revolution somewhere else in the world?

**The Colonies** 
The rise of national consciousness in the European colonies was probably inevitable. What would colonial regimes have looked like without the war?

**The Crash**
Would something like the Great Depression still have occurred? Could it have led to a war or a revolution?

&gt;Anastas Mikoyan was tasked with the negotiations with Castro over the missile transfer deal designed to prevent a breakdown in the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. While in Havana, Mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of Castro, who was convinced that Moscow had made the agreement with the United States at the expense of Cuba's defense. Mikoyan, on his own initiative, decided that Castro and his military not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs under any circumstances. He defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22, 1962. During a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan convinced Castro that despite Moscow's desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law (which didn't actually exist) to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. Castro was forced to give way and - much to the relief of Khrushchev and the whole Soviet government - the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.

My question is, what would have happened had Castro decided to seize the weapons on his own initiative?  They were fully operational, and had enough parts and fuel to be maintained domestically.",HistoricalWhatIf,1358363832,CUNTBERT_RAPINGTON,16,42,True,2013-01-16

Instead, they would have ended up in the Americas, basically dropped off with supplies to settle but not to come back.

Things to keep in mind:

Jewish communities had been segregated from mainstream society in Spain for some time at this point, so many of the illnesses that Spaniards suffered from were far less common for them.  In addition, many of the Jews of Spain were traders, conducting business across Europe and the Arab World.

*I searched this subreddit using our glorious reddit search and the only similar topic I found was one regarding if Central America didn't exist. If this topic is discussed elsewhere, please let me know, or continue here if you want to discuss it anew or with my suggestions.*

This is a subject I've pondered for a potential alternate history project, but it is different from most because not only does it depend upon alternate history, but it also depends upon a fictional geography.

As such, the discussion may necessitate a lot of scientifically-grounded discussions of climate, migration, world resources, and problems normally absent from an alternate history topic.

For our purposes, imagine the world to be the same size but lacking the American continents. If you believe it would be far wiser to discuss a world that is physically smaller, please do assert that. Again, we may be delving into more fiction than this subreddit intends. If there is a more appropriate subreddit for this discussion (besides r/fantasy), please do inform me. 

Also, depending on how many migrations and explorations of man you accept (for instance, discussions of possible Hellenistic or Celtic voyages to the New World, discussion of a Chinese visit), and assuming we don't concern ourselves with the theorized original migration of humanity (possibly across the land bridge), or decide the Americas somehow sank following this migration (without raising sea levels worldwide - I know bad science potential all over here) I see major impacts including the following:

* The Viking explorations do not reach the New World. (Did they have prior knowledge that led to these voyagers?) Would they have perished, or did they have the supplies/capabilities of supporting a longer voyage across the sea?

* Does Columbus make it all the way across the Pacific? Regardless, the Columbian Exchange would never exist.

* Without the New World, and potentially with a crossing of the Pacific leading to the Far East, how does international commerce change? Do people brave the Pacific, or stick to land passage and rounding Africa?

* How does the handling/colonization of Africa change? Lacking the copious natural resources of the New World, Africa does not afford the same benefits for colonists. Would its territory have grown exponentially in value? Would the slave trade have ceased far sooner with lesser demand lacking the New World?

* Without the space, refuge, and resources of the New World, how do international relations change?

* How does technology continue to develop? Does the industrial revolution occur as it did?

* If that world existed and continued to today, what would the world look like? What nations/peoples are dominant? How has population been affected by resources? How has technology developed? What major wars occurred?

The Christian forces were on the brink of defeat when the relief force arrived and the Ottomans were close to breaking into the last stronghold (Fort St. Michel) on the Island. Suppose the relief force had never arrived and the Ottomans had successfully breached the fortifications with minimal casualties, a massacre would have ensued and the Island of Malta falls to the Ottomans.

Malta was enormously important to the Ottoman forces because it was a key resupply point for an invasion of Italy. Estimates put the Ottoman forces to be between 25,000 and 50,000 men from across the Empire. This force would now be available for a large scale invasion of Italy with reinforcements from Africa and possibly Southern Spain.

37,What would the Americas be like if the Asian countries colonized it instead of Europe?,"Combining a few posts from earlier. Let's say that the Black Plague didn't really have an effect in Europe and as a result, the Renaissance didn't appear. Because of this, Europe's overpopulation and famine delayed many great inventions such as the Caravel(Invented ~1450 C.E.).  
With Europe still in the Middle ages, Asia thrives because of the need for goods over in Europe. Because the Silk Road is too much of a hassle for Asian merchants, China/India develops the Caravel and tries to reach Europe via the Pacific Ocean. Through this, they ""discover"" America and colonize it. Let's say that Asia develops the ""Europe syndrome"" for colonization and seeks Gold and other incentives. How do any of you think this would effect relations with native cultures i.e. how did Asia's mentality view people of other cultures/races compared to America's genocide of Native American tribes? How would a hypothetical China treat its American colonies compared to Great Britain? 
  
I understand this might not be the most logical question, but I've been pondering the instance of a history where Asia parallels Europe in America's colonization. Also, I want to renew the fact that I know little of Asian history and politics compared to Europe, and I want to have an idea of how an Asian ruled world would be different from a European ruled world.

However, he had another half-sister, Elizabeth, who later became queen after Mary.

At the time, both Mary and Elizabeth were technically illegitimate as Henry VIII's marriages to both Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyne were annulled.  Given that he had to use a royal proclamation to legitimise his cousin Lady Jane, couldn't he have just as easily legitimised his half-sister Elizabeth?

What if he had decided to make Elizabeth queen instead of Lady Jane? Knowing that Mary easily amassed a force, gained the support of the Privy Council and deposed Queen Jane, assuming it had been Queen Elizabeth instead, what might've changed if she had died in 1554?

Interesting points:
* Mary was, obviously, a Catholic and brought back Catholicism after Henry VIII's protestant split.  What if England never went back?
* She married Phillip II of Spain, a Hapsburg, who became a sort of King regent of England.  Might they have fought for the crown after she died with no children and no other English heir in waiting?

Chen advocated a multiparty federalism with Guangdong becoming the model province and the peaceful unification of China.

Could this ""model province"" idea have been successful in uniting other Chinese provinces under a multi-party federal system?

Would it have resulted in a ""Balkanization"" of China as Sun had feared?

The second plane, departing from New York City and headed towards Los Angeles, struck the Kiryas Joel Synagogue 15 minutes later.

In the likelihood that Muslims (be they the Umayyads, other local dynasties or North African ones) resisted the Castillian, Leonese, and Portugese advances of the 11-13th centuries CE, would Andalusians have eventually participated in the European Age of Discovery either as pioneers or military and commercial rivals of northern Europeans and other Iberian Christians?

32,"Silly question: If we were to (somehow) send 10,000 people back 6,000 years with nothing but their wits, how long would it take replicate our present society?","Ok folks, here’s a hypothetical question I’ve been thinking about.  Imagine that we take roughly ten thousand people from the present day and transplant them to a primeval Earth, say, six thousand years ago.  The one important catch to this scenario is that on this Earth there aren’t any humans.  There are the same continents we’re used to, the same climates, and the same flora and fauna (and of course there would be more of these two); the only difference being that humanity is noticeably out of the picture.  No villages, no farms, no nascent cultures, nothing.  It’s essentially an Earth coming out of an ice age and ripe for civilization.  Therefore on this Earth there would exist roughly the same conditions our ancestors were privy to at the beginning of their civilizations, except that in this scenario there are no ancestors, just the select ten thousand I previously mentioned.  That being said…



These ten thousand people (equal parts male and female) would represent the pinnacle of human knowledge in all fields; they would be engineers, architects, doctors, nurses, chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, craftsmen, plumbers, electricians, writers, musicians, artists, historians, farmers, businesspeople, etc.  Essentially they would embody all of the knowledge gained during our thousands of years of civilization.  And transported back with them would be a bookshelf, maybe thirty feet long and eight feet high, which contained within it books that run the gamut on all the aforementioned professions in a very succinct and precise fashion.  And that’s it.  Maybe they’d be sent back with a few fur rags so they wouldn’t die from exposure but that’s all they would get.  Every other thing they wanted they’d have to make literally from the ground up.



So essentially the question I’m pondering is how long it would take these people to attain a level of technology we’re accustomed to today if every THING that we take for granted was taken away from them.  No tools, no houses…not even a cleared patch of land for planting – or domesticated crops to plant.  They would essentially have to progress from the Stone Age to the Information Age starting at square one.  Their one advantage in all of this – and it’s a big one – is knowledge, for it’s this knowledge upon which our society is based, and there wouldn’t have to be as much struggle or trial and error.  But would they put their nose to the grindstone and get to work?  Would they fall into some ridiculous autocracy despite the historical precedents they are sure to know about?  Would some dick try and burn all the books to prove a point?  Or would they recognize all of the faults in our present society, and use their collective wisdom to make a utopia?  Would they set up a market economy or would they try some collectivization scheme?  Or perhaps they might try one and move onto the other.  Would they skip from stone tools to steam engines?

58,[Meta] A constructive discussion about reposts,"Hi all. Just by way of intro, I'm a new moderator (a few months now), but I've been fairly quiet (but actively moderating!) until now.

There was a discussion today about reposts, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/14rt6k/meta_reposts_every_single_day/). My conclusion after some discussion was that we need some kind of index of frequently asked questions (in the HistoricalWhatIf sense) and associated discussions. I think the place to do that is in the wiki:  http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/wiki/.

I've set the wiki to be editable by anyone with ~~100~~ **edit: 10** /r/HistoricalWhatIf karma (that's right, karma means something now).

If you have any objection to this treatment of the issue, please voice it now.

It's up to you (the /r/HistoricalWhatIf community) to create this FAQ, and to point people at it when they repost. Of course, I'll put a link in the sidebar once it's reached a useful point. By the way, when you visit the main /r/HistoricalWhatIf page, there's a wiki link at the top.

Lastly, there's still one open question: should reposts be removed? If so, when is it acceptable to re-open discussion or try again? And can you give me any guidance on how similar is too similar? (Because I'm sure people will try to tell me that their submission wasn't exactly the same as the one they appear to be reposting.)

One more thing: my approach here is that I don't want to punish people for reposting. I think we can be courteous about this. In general, if someone posts a question that was asked in the last month or so, they really will appreciate being pointed to a quality earlier discussion on the subject.",HistoricalWhatIf,1355401622,anonymous7,23,38,True,2012-12-13

And a curious thought struck me: what if the Third Punic War never took place?

Let's set the stage.  It's 151 BC.  Carthage is an economic superpower that repaid its ""crushing reparations"" to Rome in no time at all.  They have raised an army to repel a Numidian invasion (which failed miserably, but that's beside the point).  The city of Rome is growing larger and larger, and they are having a hard time keeping all their citizens fed.  They look to Carthage and its territories, and see a rich area that is ripe for plundering.  They also have an excuse to go to war with Carthage - since Numidia was a Roman ally, they can use this ""Punic aggression"" in their favor.  We have Cato the Elder uttering the phrase ""Carthago delenda est"" at every opportunity.  Rome is making demands of Carthage at the point of a sword, trying to provoke them into declaring war.

Now, freeze time for a minute.  What if Rome and Carthage are able to find some way to peacefully co-exist?  Maybe Rome is satisfied with the Carthaginian tributes.  Maybe Carthage decides that war with Rome will destroy them, and they agree to permanently submit to Roman rule.  Maybe a thousand other things happen - the point is, the Third Punic War never begins, and Carthage (as it existed then) is never wiped off the map.

How would this affect the landscape of the Mediterranean as we know it today?  Would Roman aggression during the period of the Empire end up becoming too much, finally destroying the city?  Would their rich lands and economy have spared them that fate, allowing Carthage to remain while the Roman Empire crumbled?  Or would the Vandals have simply wiped them out before turning their attention north to Rome?

Even after the provincial government broke its pledge to the Russian troops to only fight a defensive war, the [July Days](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_Days) strikes failed miserably at a time [when even Josef Stalin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin#The_April_Theses) supported the provisional government over the Petrograd Soviet.  Even after the specter of the suppression of the July Days strikes, the [Bolsheviks only held 33% of the vote, while among the socialists Lenin's April Theses for violent revolution were derided as ""the ravings of a madman,"" and Bolshevik attempts to set up their own council of soviets ""only gained the support of eight out of 169 soldiers' or worker's soviets"" support](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrograd_Soviet#Rise_of_the_Bolsheviks ).  Even after the forceful overthrow of the Provincial Government, democratic elections gave the party that dominated the government they overthrew, [Kerensky's Menshevik Socialist-Revolutionary party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Constituent_Assembly_election,_1917) gained a plurality of the vote, with the Bolsheviks earning less than a fourth (an event that caused Lenin to dissolve the assembly within a day of the first meeting).

&gt;Worldwar is a series of novels by Harry Turtledove whose premise is an alien invasion of Earth in the middle of World War II. The military invasion begins on or around May 30, 1942, but the aliens, who call themselves the Race, reached Earth orbit in December 1941.

&gt;Although the Race, a reptilian species, has the advantage of superior technology, their information on humans was collected by a robotic probe during the 12th century. The invaders are surprised to find that humanity has progressed far more rapidly any other species they had previously studied. At the time of invasion the Race's technology is only marginally more advanced than current 20th century Earth technology.

&gt;The narrative follows the intersecting fortunes of a large number of human and alien characters. Notably, the series depicts how the Axis and Allied powers must cooperate to fight the alien menace.

I'm sure that some are wondering ""The aliens only have early 21st century military technology?  Why are they so behind?""  The reason why is because A) The aliens are a unified race and have been so since they got to this level of technology.  Hence no military production unless they conquer planets and no military innovation.  B) The aliens are very conservative and bad at adapting.  A good human analogy would be imperial China.

2. Religious practices are based on the need to survive, as listening to elders as young humans and assuming what they say is true increased our chances of survival.

3. Somewhere along the lines, as we didn't have the real answers, some people created the concept of ""gods"" to explain the natural world and this helped to legitimatize what elders were saying, and this was passed on through the collective consciousness. This worldview beat out the reality-based worldview more than 2,000 years ago in Ancient Greece.

Ancient Greece is where the most interesting part of this Historical What-If happens. Certain philosophers like Aristotle were already developing a form of secular philosophy, but it did not manage to overcome the evolutionary power provided to religion. 

**If the Roman Empire and the rest of the Western World had been shaped by these philosophers' quest to understand our reality, instead of Christianity, Islam and organized religion in general, how would the next 2,000 years have played out?**

Sub-questions to think about:

1. Would scientific development have happened much faster?

2. How would politics and borders been impacted?

3. Would the Roman Empire have existed without Christianity, if not, what would have spread instead?

We are allowed to take information from any time of the culture's empire (For instance, we are saying that the Spartans had around 25,000 soldiers, the Peloponnesian War) From talking to them, they claim that they had a mass of cannons and guns. We will give a presentation on tactics used by the Spartans, and the opposing team will give one regarding the Samurai. The battle itself is a timed, fast-paced exchange. One team will be chosen to defend, the other will attack. Team A will give an attack, and a brief description of going about it. Team B will be given a chance to defend, and a brief description of going about it. There will be 3 attacks, and 3 defenses. Then the roles switch.

81,"ok, another Nazi one; would we know about the holocaust if the Nazi's won the war? what would we think of it?","Standard fare; England capitulates, full force of arms defends the eastern front and a stalemate between Russia and Nazi Germania (formerly old europe) causes the war to grind to a halt and drift into a cold-war similar to the american-russian one in the real era - America quietly backs down and does it's own thing greatly diminished in power and influence but still free and progressive, possible very isolationist in a similar way to China of the same era.  

To me this is a very interesting question, i see three main options;
  
it's totally removed from history and no one ever hears of it - i think this is unlikely for a couple of reasons, Europe would notice if all the Jews suddenly vanished; certainly it's very unlikely that ALL Jews and Jewish allies would be killed, portions of the Jewish population had already been 'set aside' after the failure of the ""Schlußaktion der Berliner Juden"" (Closing Berlin Jew Action), and it's worth noting that a popular and peaceful protest caused this [more here](http://www.rosenstrasse-protest.de/texte/texte_stoltzfus.html) an important exert;
  
&gt;Joseph Goebbels, in his role as the Nazi Party Director for Berlin, decided that the simplest way to end the protest was to release the Jews. Goebbels chose not to forcibly tear Jews from Aryans who clearly risked their lives to stay with their Jewish family members, and rationalized that he would deport the Jews later anyway.  
  
Had they been victorious then either these Jews would be quietly forgotten about or quietly murdered, maybe with their German family... but then those Germans and children of Germans and friends, etc - this would not be an easy situation for the Nazi party desperately trying to maintain power under the pressure of a pax-victorious.  
  
It's almost certain that it'd be a fairly well known event, even those involved are bound to blab - retrospect can be a cruel thing.  
  
So the party would have two options, hold back questions until it's far too late and everyone simply has to shake their head and say 'a terrible thing' much like the most English do about many genocidal wars of aggression we've been involved in on every single continent... Or to say 'we did a good thing!' presumably by downplaying their brutality and emphasizing that they were forced into it - much like how we explain away dropping nukes on cities full of civilians and carpet bombing the inhabitants of Dresden.  
  
The stated desires of the Nazi party was to return all Jews to Palestine once the British Imperialists had been kicked out - personally i think they'd certainly have done that as a great excuse to engage in a protracted war in the middle east, it's unlikely the german people would be up for another war so some excuse would be found; most people over look the fact that Germany pretended to be acting in self difference when it started all it's invasions, even going so far as to stage an aggression on the polish boarder (IIRC?) and this wasn't so much due to international pressure but because propaganda was super important to get the will of the people supporting the cause - so some excuse would be found  ( maybe protecting the jews from muslims, similar to the allied excuse for the last seventy years of middle eastern intervention) 

this would be important of course because controlling the middle east oil was very obviously going to decided who was the economic superpower of the century (in actual history america and britain do this)  
 
I think they'd try to push the line that almost nothing bad happened and what did was for the good of everyone - certainly as the nazi's wouldn't trust the Jewish state with nukes like america did, they'd be a large Nazi occupation in Palestine which presumably would have the Palestinians treated even worse than they are now and would radically change the face of Zionism; Israel as more of a giant prison for Jews  than a self-autonomous Jewish run prison for Palestinians...  for a start the Knesset wouldn't exist and the other Rothschild gifts obviously wouldn't have been made so it'd be a much poorer and less influential nation - and even the presence of successful and vocal Jews in America would be greatly diminished on the world stage, yet of course there would be pressure and statements from around the world and questions inside the german population - now free from the stresses of war and ready to demand liberty and progress, just as any peoples at peace tend to do.  
  
So which is it?  Do they try to deny it, try to pretend it wasn't that bad or shake their head and say 'how terrible, such a shame...'

The hearty men of the Kievan Rus' wake up one day in 900 CE to find their fields replaced with great trees, their rain heavy, and the climate hot.  Astonished, they start cultivating the rain forest for a while, exporting the hearty lumber, and allying with the Novgorod Republic eventually.

On the same day, the Siberian Khanates find their tundras turned into rich lands not dissimilar to Poland.  They get to work, forming large industrial centers.  The mongols can't make a dent, stopping the invasion at the Urals.  Ogodei dies in a swift counter attack, and the Mongols return home, defeated.


The Grand Duchy of Moscow, instead of conquering the old states, forms a great alliance, the Tsardom of Russia.  Population growth greatly expands, and a treaty is forged with the Siberians, exchanging lumber for industry.  Eventually, they are conquered and added to the Tsardom.

The Empire reaches it's old heights today, but takes Finland, and northern Mongolia.  The West seems a prime target for the taking, but it is more profitable to sell the Kievan lumber to them, rather than subjugating them.  The Tsardom is eventually replaced with a Democratic, Capitalist government.  

WWI is avoided, but when Hitler becomes a large threat, Russia intervenes.  General Winter is no longer a problem, but General Monsoon is prevalent.  Hitler invades Poland at the same time, and makes an immediate push towards Kiev, in attempt to stop the nation in it's tracks.  He is decimated by tanks and aircraft, and makes a hasty retreat to Poland, his army only a fraction of what it was before.

Poland is captured in May, 1942, and Hitler pulls back all his forces from France, as D-Day comes early.  He forms an incredible defensive barrier around Germany, and stops the holocaust, instead drafting the remaining ""undesirables"" as conscripts.  They are thrown at Russian forces, but as many as 50% defect.  The others perish.

The war ends badly for Germany. Poland and France are liberated, and Italy didn't do a damn thing, leaving the only fascist governments surrounded by strong capitalist allies.  Germany is put under the occupation of Russian forces.  Everything goes well until China happens.

The Chinese civil war in China is pretty much fought to a stalemate without Russian assistance, and is left in shambles until the Communists manage to steal an American nuke planned to be launched from China to strike Japan.  They hold the country hostage and begin reverse engineering and duplicating them.  The Cold War starts between Russia and Communist China, each building more nukes and amassing ground forces around each other's borders.  30 years of stockpiling, and in 1980, the Nationalists finally make a breakthrough.

In response, TR bolted from the Republican party to form the Bull Moose party to run on a progressive platform.  In that year, the Democrats nominate New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson as their presidential candidate to run on a platform of ""small government.""  So, let's say Teddy wins in 1912 and gets his third term as President of the United States:

Would WWI have started?  What would America's role be in WWI? Intervention or isolation?

What would further progressive legislation look like under a third Roosevelt term?  Would there be a split in the Democratic or Republican party?  If so, would it be significant enough to effectively kill one of the two major parties? 

How would the Democrats and Republicans react to Roosevelt breaking with Washington's two-term tradition?

How would it change over time? How would this effect the Beor republics? And the British Empire?
 
The forces against the war
--------------------------
 
The British Government in London didn't want it as they saw it as a lot of expense for very little gain. They refused to move more troops into Natal in order to fight when Frere asked them to, and repeatedly told him that they did not want a fight. This was not a front either as can be seen by the fact that after the war was eventually won Frere was not given any praise at all, and was instead quietly shifted to a low ranking role were he could never try anything like the Zulu War again.
 
Sir Henry Bulwer, Governer of Natal, didn't want war. He was quite happy rubbing along with Cetshwayo with whom he had a  working relationship based on the fact that neither he nor Cetshwayo wanted to prevoke the other.
 
Cetshwayo really didn't want war and had already gone to great lengths to plicate the British and Beors. This can even be seen during his conduct of the war where he refused to invade Natal after his victory at Insandwala, and pulled his troops away from defeating the defenders at Rouke's Drift because it was on the wrong side of the border. He even gave orders that those not wearing red coats should be not be killed to try and reduce civilian casualties, a fact that meant that some British officers in navy blue patrol jackets were spared.
 
The forces for the war
----------------------
 
[Sir Theophilus Shepstone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophilus_Shepstone) wanted war, as a way of shoring up is extremely precarious position as the head of the recently annexed Transvaal. However on his own his barely had enough military strength to keep himself in power had the Beors decided to revolt.
 
Some of the Beors on the border wanted war, or at least an end to the tit-for-tat cattle raids across the border and more land. However they didn't even have the political cohetion to be able to dislodge Shepstone, and the last Commando that they had sent into Zululand against a chieftain that Cetshwayo nolonger chose to protect had been beaten off.

52,What if the interwar French army was more open to professional mechcanized forces with cocentrated armour and reformed accordingly?,"Throughout the interwar period, Charles De Gaulle and a few others were outspoken about the creation of a professional army (his theories culminating in 1935 into his book: Army of the Future) with an offensive capability through mechanization and massed tank attacks to strike hard at the enemy wherever they appeared without waiting for conscripts to be raised and mobilized. 

In reality, one of the reasons De Gaulle's theory did not gain much traction was due to the fact his concepts went against the popular and romantic tradition of mass mobilization to defend the nation with citizen-soldiers and this concept was further cemented into place as professional armies failed in the 1870-71 war against Germany and the conscription approach won the Great War. 

There were also worries that a creation of an offensive-geared army would provoke Germany and that it was easier to motivate soldiers by having them fight at home rather than abroad.

For the purposes of this scenario, let us say that the French greatly took stock of the vast scale of losses through trench warfare and soon wanted to go back to a more cavarly like approach and realised that tanks and trucks were a means to realizing this modern take on manouvre warfare, coupled with the realization that static defences cannot be relied upon since a manouvre army avoids attacking these if possible.

I've already written a long post, so to put it breifly, I believe that a professional army would have made the prospect of protecting Czechslovakia through a sudden strike against Germany and put them on the defensive. Alternatively, if they did not go to war over this and tried to play appeasment, the more blitzkreig like mindset would grant France a more flexible defence and would be more open to the idea of an attack coming in through the Ardennes since De Gaulle had asked questions regarding this issue beforehand. 

What are your thoughts regarding this radical reform and to expand the discussion if you so wish how would the British react to this mindset?

I posted this what if a while back, but never got any responses, but I thought it was interesting enough to try and discuss again:

Historically Germany built 1,200 four engine strategic bombers during WW2 that were better than the B17 bomber...had they worked. They had massive problems with their engines because they were using two welded together engines to run a single massive propellor on each wing. Why? Because the head of the Luftwaffe technical department though that a heavy bomber should be able to launch a dive bombing attack like a Stuka. The redesigns and increases in weight, plus the use of the two giant propellors (which improved aerodynamics for a dive attack) turned a decent design into a death trap that more often than not caught fire and killed the crew, earning it the nickname 'the Luftwaffe's lighter'. **So what if instead of requiring this aircraft to be able to dive bomb the Luftwaffe stuck with a four propellor design that would be used for level bombing?** Germany had pretty good bomb sights, even managing to steal the Norden bombsight from the US in 1940, giving them an improved version by January 1941.

The aircraft was eventually (1943) reworked into the He177B, which looked like the later He277.  It was operational by 1945, but by then the war was long lost and made no difference.  I included the links above to give an idea about the type and to show that the He177B with four propellors was workable, because historically when the two propellor idea was abandoned, the bomber actually was functional.

So what does the community think? Could the Heinkel 177 with its massive bomb capacity and range have made a different to WW2?",HistoricalWhatIf,1352156073,wiking85,1,1,True,2012-11-05

1,I wrote this as a prologue to a story I was thinking of making an independent film. It's an Alternate history to set the stage.  A whole lot of what ifs in here. ,"After Canada achieved independence in 1867 via the Constitution Act, The US, still stinging from their defeat in the war of 1812 didn't like that very much and tried to muscle in on the newly formed country and invaded.

 Canada's first and last Prime minister, John A. Macdonald, appealed to the British crown, the UK military came and repelled the American encroachment at great cost to Britain. The Constitution act was repealed and Canada once again became a British possession. The British, themselves still sore over the loss of the American Colonies, stifled any dissent and made sure that the Canadian Territories would never again seek independence.  They levied a heavy tax on the Canadian territories, scaring away most business ventures. The Hudson Bay Company became a property of the Crown.  It was used to supply the few farmers and herders that remained in Canada.  Canada for the most part became merely a food production and raw material supplier for Europe, the Crown never removed the heavy taxes so motivation to immigrate to Canada for private purposes was never very high.

The expansion west was hampered by competition from the Americans, The dominion lands Proposal of 1872 put an end to most disputes after it mandated a full and complete land survey of all lands north of the 49th parallel and west of the border of Upper Canada (now the district of Ontario).

The native population was pacified much the same way as the population of India had been by the British East India Company. But the native population wasn't large enough to exploit in the same manner as the East Indians had been.  There are differing opinions on whether or not this had been a good thing for the natives.

This was done by the British North America Company. The BNAC Took the place of the Hudson Bay Company after the nationalization of all resources of Canada in order for the crown to recoup the losses incurred by the British military when they repulsed the American invasion.

Fort Calgary became a center of commerce for the locals; mostly as a demarcation point for shipments of grain and other foods headed east back to the UK by the BNAC. Under direct charter by the Crown, the BNAC had been granted almost exclusive rights to exploit the resources of the Canadian Territories.

The shire of Calgary was created in 1903 as an administrative district. The Reeve's office was formed that same year to oversee the populace of workers/farmers and their families. The Reeve's office as the law enforcement arm of the British crown in the Canadian North American Territories was responsible for the protection of the populace from the few savages that remain and the enforcing of laws and production quotas as well as enforcing the taxes imposed by the crown and hunting down tax evaders.

A few attempts at land grabs, usually under the pretense of pursuing Native Indian bands hostile to the American government have occurred over the years, and the border has shifted marginally over time.

In 1923 after two companies (Imperial Oil and British North American Oil) were granted exploitation rights over Alberta's new found oil reserves, much to the chagrin of BNAC, refineries were built in Calgary. Shortly thereafter the Americans attempted an invasion to seize Alberta's southern oil fields. After an initial incursion their advance was slowed near Lethbridge long enough for forces from Ontario to arrive and repel the invasion again. The resulting counter attack by the King’s forces resulted in the capture of the northern halves of Montana, Idaho and Washington State. The directors of BNAC were tried and found guilty of collusion and treason against the Crown when it was discovered that they had conspired with the American government when promised economic control of Alberta's oil reserves. BNAC was dissolved and the government took a more direct hand in the operations of the territory. Wilfred Laurier was appointed a territorial governor of the eastern Canadian Territories in 1924; Samuel Bennett was appointed governor of the Western Canadian Territory in 1925.

Canada was left relatively unscathed in WWI. Thanks to the raw materials and food production of Canada used to support the allied war effort in Europe.  The Kaisers forces were defeated in 1917.

In 1921 dispensation was given to local businesses doing business locally and the oppressive crown taxes were waved. Local sales and business taxes were levied by the governors on local businesses.  The Crown taxes still applied to large corporations attempting to do business in Canada so there was still little interest in Canada by the corporations of other countries.

The population of Canada was approximately 4.5 million in 1930, not including natives. A comprehensive survey of the natives was never done.  Few of them ever tried to assimilate to the British ways although there was significant local trade done with the locals for furs and exotic meats to be preserved and shipped to Europe.

In 1928 a resurgence of the earlier 1918 flu pandemic again decimated the populations of Europe, the USA and parts of Asia. As a direct result technological advancement was almost halted, In Germany, one of the victims was a young politician named Adolph Hitler. In 1932 President Hindenburg was re-elected without opposition, in the hope that the stability he promised would help them recover from the losses caused by the plague.  He lived another 3 years in the office. He was succeeded by Franz von Papen. The Nazi party of Germany lost many of its most prominent members in the pandemic, and as a result it never gained much prominence in German Politics. Franz von Papen was assassinated in 1939 and a new election followed his death. 

The plague decimated populace turned to religion to help assuage the grief and fears that arose as a result of the pandemic, and as in the first dark ages, a sort of miasma against technology developed. Any pushes for advancement in technology were met with angry mobs. And in many cases, the technology was abandoned completely. The world population had dropped to numbers not seen since the 1400’s.   By 1950 the tech level had settled into a level approximately like that of the turn of the century level, or earlier depending on the location. In some of the more remote areas all traces of modern technology disappeared.  Asia, lacking the motivating force of industrialization in the western world turned in on itself, and became like most of its history, static. Australia was left pretty much to its own devices, not having felt the touch of the plague, they managed to get by, but being mostly cut off from the rest of the world, they too settled in for the long haul. In the Territory of Canada, order continued to be maintained by the Reeve’s office on behalf of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second. 

A second dark age had come to Mankind.

This got me thinking - Which empire do you believe was most likely to (or even possibly could have) controlled the whole world. I know this is a seriously unlikely 'what if' so ill include a couple of basic conditions to narrow it down.

1. I don't mean every square inch of land on the planet I mean controlling the institutions of countries who had the potential to strike back. For example the British Empire would needed to have controlled countries such as France and Russia but not necessarily Madagascar, central Africa etc.

2. Take the empire at the height of its power and factor in previous territories. So, using the British example again, you can use the notion that they never lost control of America and thus had crown rule in India at the same time as they controlled American colonies.

3. Be as creative as possible - I want to hear some outlandish stories. If you can make an argument for a remote tribe in Iceland I want to hear it. Extra point if you can make a convincing argument for the French! (British joke!)

* The Weapon can be fictional but must tie into some sort of legend or myth.

On 22 October 1947 the Pakistani armed forces crossed the border with the claim that they needed to suppress a rebellion on the southeast of the kingdom. Local tribal militias and the Pakistani forces moved to take Srinagar but on reaching Uri they encountered defensive forces. [**The Maharaja of Kashmir, still a princely state at the time**] Hari Singh made a plea to India for assistance and signed the Instrument of Accession. The British government also took part in stopping the Pakistani forces from advancing.
The war was initially fought by the forces of the princely state and tribal militias from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Federally Administered Tribal Areas. **Facing the assault and a Muslim revolution in the Poonch and Mirpur area, the ruler of princely state of Kashmir and Jammu signed an Instrument of Accession to the Indian union. Indian and Pakistani armies entered the war subsequently.** The fronts solidified gradually along what came to be known as the Line of Control.

It's hard to imagine just how in control and popular Huey Long was in Louisiana during the 30's and 40's and his popularity nation wide was increasing every year to the point that he was running for president in 1936 before he was killed.

He was also easily the most progressive southern Governor who made great strides at trying to get equal rights for blacks (more so they would vote for him then for any sense of justice, but the effect was the same).

How would things have been different if the electoral college did not exist and the popular candidate won the presidency?

57,What if Eisenhower had allowed ID White and the 2nd Armored (or Patton's 3rd Army as a whole) to take Berlin?,"Earlier, on the edge of Paris, General White, arguably the most important Armored General in WWII (Including Patton), was ordered to stand down and allow LeClerc to take Paris, preventing him from being the first American General to take the city. Then, again, on the Outskirts of Berlin, he was told to stand down AGAIN, and allow Zhukov and the Reds to take the city.

I will offer 2 Separate What Ifs:

First, and more likely, General White would be more well known. His writings on a rapid deployment force [Alternative to Armageddon](http://books.google.com/books/about/Alternative_to_Armageddon.html?id=Y-4EAAAAMAAJ) are essentially what our Army is becoming. This was published in 1970, BTW. Maybe he would have held more sway in the post WWII US Army...

Second, The Russians were already on edge and they had no intention of allowing Democracy into areas they had taken. There have been unproven rumors for years that American Officers were taken prisoner in the chaos when the armies met and sent to the Gulag. 

Either way, the Russians did not know we had the A-Bomb. If they had pressed us, perhaps it would have (and maybe should have) come to war. Maybe they would have if they felt we were to aggressive.

Then, America would have used more A-Bombs to negate the Red Armies numerical superiority (and perhaps the fanaticism of Soviet Leadership), and allowed the 3rd Army headed by Patton to take the war to Moscow. 

No Cold War and a Pax Americana from the Atlantic to the Pacific--- In Europe and Asia. Colonialism would be much slower to end, with India and the Mid-East remaining British. I think China still would have gone Red though. Soviet support for Mao was always a myth, more words than guns. Mao took China by himself and the PLAs devotion. I also think that Vietnam/French Indo-China would have ended up the same way, Civil war and Chaos. 

That's the immediate effects. Without a Soviet Union, things like Cuba, Marxism in Africa/Latin America etc etc.... Who knows?",HistoricalWhatIf,1350499551,apikoros18,10,5,True,2012-10-17

World War 3.

China invades Russia for oil reserves in Siberia. The US and UK come to the aid of Russia. OPEC countries (seeking to add a potentially oil rich China into their monopoly) and most Islamic countries (seeing a good time to rally against the US) all side with China. The rest of the western world (preaching peace and condemning US involvement as war mongering) not surprisingly, remain neutral.

With Europe’s neutrality and Islamic Turkey siding with China, NATO dissolves. The UN is powerless. The US is then forced into a global war stretching from Morocco to Indonesia which includes the worlds most populous country with the largest military. 

The first theater or war is the jungles of Venezuela. The US moves to quickly grab as much oil as possible since many of their suppliers are now enemies. The Venezuelan army is organized and anticipates such an action. They retreat into fortified jungles and await the US forces. They are more prepared then any force the US faced in Vietnam in an area ten times the size and they are constantly being resupplied by their many many allies. 

As oil reserves dwindle in the US, the government hordes the supply for the war effort. Gas prices for civilians shoot to $100/gallon. Shipping becomes economically impossible. Inflation runs rampant. Food prices increase 10 fold which lead to riots, looting, and murder across the US.  Civil order is destroyed.

94,"I got carried away answering ""What if Mexico had agreed to ally with Germany after the Zimmerman Telegram"", and then OP deleted it. So I am sharing my answer with you anyway. ","Mexico, still bitter about the Mexican-American war of 1846 and eager to stamp out the revolution of Emiliano Zapata (who Mexico suspected was being aided by the United States), receives the Zimmerman Telegram, unintercepted by British Intelligence. Having their army already mobilized and fighting in the North, Mexico drafts their own version of the ""Schliefen Plan"" which aspired to capture huge grabs of territory and then sue for peace before their foe realizes that they cannot hold the territory. They secretly agree to an alliance with the Central Powers and begin receiving shipments of weapons from Germany as well as funds to buy weapons and supplies from America, ostensibly to fight Zapata.

The US, though increasing production of war materials in order to sell to both sides (well, mainly the British), has not mobilized or prepared its forces for war. Although beefing up its naval presence, the number of troops remains pitifully small. 

1918: Mexico launches an attack, seizing the US naval shipyards in San Diego and the main commercial hub in Los Angeles before the U.S. is even aware of the attack. Arizona and New Mexico are quickly taken; the few forces on the border with Mexico (ironically, there to help capture Zapata) are captured or killed in the first few days. Mexican forces march up California and are stopped at the head of the Salinas Valley, cutting off their march to San Francisco. In Texas, border towns are quickly overwhelmed, as is San Antonio. The Mexican army bypasses the capital of Austin and instead heads straight to Houston, hoping to cut off supplies arriving by sea. Texas, notorious for its independent nature, quickly rallies the militia. Houston is torn apart by brutal, street to street fighting. Mexico sets fire to the city, hoping to burn out their enemies. 

The government in Washington is taken completely by surprise. Saboteurs cut railway lines and telegraph lines throughout the country, having had time to infiltrate across the porous, lawless border ahead of time. Initial reports had mistaken for the invasion as a domestic troop revolution, because Mexico's soldiers were armed with US weapons and had made counterfeit US military uniforms. Washington moved quickly to lock down remaining troops in the country, hoping to stop the spread of the non-resistant revolt. This significantly slowed their response to the invasion, allowing Mexico to solidify its gains. 

4 days after the invasion began, the Senate officially declares war on Mexico. The Mexican Ambassador, who had remained behind in Washington so as not to raise suspicions, is arrested and hung from the White House portico. The Senate simultaneously passed a mandatory draft (Although not necessary, as recruitment offices were overwhelmed by volunteers), and declares war on Germany and the other Central powers.

Naval forces from San Francisco, Oregon, and Washington mount a counter-offensive as the garrison in Salinas continues to block movement into Northern California. Amphibious landings manage to retake sections of Los Angeles, San Diego. Furthermore, forces land in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and begin fighting up the Baja Peninsula. 

In Texas, reinforcements arrive by rail (where possible) and by sea from Louisiana and Florida. Both sides commit the majority of their forces to the Battle of Houston. Galveston is retaken and becomes the beachhead for forces arriving from the East Coast. 

After 8 bloody days, Houston is retaken and Mexican forces retreat to San Antonio. Well supplied and fortified, they manage to fend off all attacks from pursuing militia. Directed by German military advisers, they dig trenches and await the main force of the U.S. military. Mexico tries contacting the US government, offering peace in exchange for holding territory in Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. The US government doesn't even respond. 

**2 weeks after the invasion**: Mexican forces remain in control of New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Nevada, Colorado, and California. US forces have manages to retake most of Los Angeles and San Diego, although Mexican guerrillas saturate the hills around L.A. In Texas, Houston has been utterly destroyed but retaken; the Mexican Army has settled into San Antonio, awaiting a longer battle. US forces have been stopped in Baja Mexico at Santa Rosalia and have also become entrenched. The first battalions of US Regulars arrive in Texas from other states. After a devastating first assault on San Antonio, with casualty estimates as high as 25%, U.S. forces decide instead to encircle the city and starve them out. 

**1 month after the invasion**: US forces defeated outside Santa Rosalia retreat back to Cabo San Lucas; resupply and reinforcement efforts are hampered by German U-Boats, who have been diverted from the war in the Atlantic to aid Mexico. Mexican forces in California, cut off from the South, make their way into the Central Valley of CA in order to resupply from the many farms in the region. They are doggedly pursued by US forces, and employ a ""scorch and burn"" tactic, devastating the region. Minor skirmishes take place up and down the state. In Texas, Mexican forces in San Antonio show few signs of running out of supplies. The US Army brings in heavy artillery and begins non-stop blasting of the city. 

**2 Months after invasion**: Mexican forces in California are destroyed at the Battle of Fresno as they try to make their way into the mountains and join up with forces in Nevada. US Troops push through Arizona and New Mexico before being stopped at Albequerque by entrenched Mexican forces. In Texas, the U.S. army continues its siege of San Antonio after repeated, failed attempts to break through Mexico's lines. Mexico employs chemical warfare (from Germany) with devastating effectiveness. US troops begin bypassing the city and fighting their way into Mexico, retaking the Rio Grande and occupying Matamoros. US Marines land at Veracruz and take the city with almost no resistance. This becomes a hub of landing more soldiers and spreading through Southern Mexico. Indigenous peoples in the Yucatan rise up against Mexico and join US forces, establishing their own independent nation on the Yucatan Peninsula. US troops from California begin pushing into the Baja region while simultaneously pushing up from Cabo San Lucas. The peninsula is taken in a matter of days and the army invests Hermosilla. 

**3 months after invasion**: San Antonio finally falls to US forces when Mexican forces run low on ammunition and attempt to break the siege and retreat toward Mexico. The government of Mexico sends envoys to the United States in order to negotiate a treaty. An angry mob, goaded by journalists pushing for punishment of Mexico, lynches the envoys. President Wilson issues a statement declaring that the United States can no longer consider itself safe until Mexico's government falls. US forces have seized all of the border states of Mexico as well as Sinaloa and Durango. Much other Southern Mexico has seceded and many major coastal cities have been captured. US troops move slowly toward Mexico City, hampered by the lack of infrastructure in arid Northern Mexico. Railroad tracks are laid at a breakneck pace. Reinforcements stream into the country with no end in site. 

**4 months after invasion**: Western Mexico secedes and allies itself with the United States. Mexican forces surrender en masse as the US marches toward Mexico City. The US has recognized the independent countries of Yucatan and Oaxaca. The government of Mexico recalls all remaining forces to Mexico City to man the defenses. Washington still refuses to negotiate terms of surrender until the government has fallen. Planes come into widespread use, being used to drop propaganda and threats into Mexican cities. Angry mobs set fire to large sections of the city, and soldiers are forced to abandon their defenses to put down the revolt. Government officials try to flee and are captured on their way to Puerto Vallarta, where a U-boat waited to take them to Germany. The President of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz, hangs himself in the presidential palace, and Mexico City is taken without a fight.

**5 Months After Surrender**: Much of Northern Mexico, as well as the east coast of Mexico, is annexed by the United States. The State of Mexico is all that remains of the Country of Mexico.

Hannibal still seeks vengeance against Rome, Caesar still seeks glory for Rome, and Alexander still seeks personal glory. 


One scenario I think could happen: Caesar wishes to expand Rome northward still to avoid too large a war with Carthage or Macedon till he's at the helm of fiercely loyal legion or two. He invades Gaul and years pass with him achieving countless victories. Hannibal takes this chance to march towards Roman territory and begin his assault upon the Republic. The Gauls hear of this, and pledge allegiance so they can finally defeat Caesar. Vercingetorix brings his army to meet Hannibal and legitimize the alliance. Caesar hears of this and sends for more legions from Rome. Caesar sets up a series of blockades and fortresses ahead of the Alps to block Hannibal, and receives word that more legions are on the way. Hannibal and Caesar end up having to wage war in that area, and the surrounding areas. Both of them attempting to trick the other with false retreats and surprising routes. I am unsure who would win.

Then Alexander who was planning his conquest of the East learns of this clash and believes it is time to act against the West first so his Kingdom won't fall prey to either Rome or Carthage. He marches on Rome while the victor from Gaul, either Hannibal (who wants to destroy Rome himself, not someone else) or Caesar (who wants to protect Rome), rush to Rome as fast as possible to prevent Alexander from razing or claiming it. Once again, not sure who would prevail. 

If Alexander wins: He conquers Rome, then heads to Carthage with similar results.

If Hannibal wins: He burns Rome, then heads to Macedon to punish them for Alexanders actions.

If Caesar wins: He saves Rome, then waits to rebuild his weakened legions and repair Rome. Then Rome eventually razing/assimilating Carthage and Macedon.


So, the simple question is who would be victorious? And as follow up: Would Rome still reach it's greatest extent/Would Carthage instead become the mightiest empire/Would Macedon last?

I realize this may not even qualify to be here and if so I apologize and will remove it.

28,What if Lyndon Johnson exposed Nixon's treasonous secret negotiations with North Vietnam in 1968 and stayed in the presidential race?,"A little known bit of history is that coming up on the 1968 election, Johnson was in peace negotiations with the North Vietnamese that were a near done deal, but Nixon secretly told the North that if they stalled until after the election, which would help him win, he would give them a better deal.

It turned out Johnson knew about the whole thing and complained to Republican Senate leader Everett Dirksen on the phone (and that tape has been released) but did not publicly accuse or prosecute Nixon.

Besides LBJ dropping out of the race and his replacement losing the election, Nixon went on to continue the war through his first term before ending it on terms about the same as Johnson had been working on in 1968.

If LBJ, had revealed all this and stayed in the race, he would have saved the lives of every soldier who died while Nixon was in office.

But if he got that second term of his own and successfully ended the Vietnam War sooner, would he be remembered more for his Great Society domestic programs and signing Civil Rights legislation?  Would his historical reputation be closer to that of FDR than it is to Nixon in reality?

Would there also have been the disconnect between how average people viewed him and the financial elite did, as happened with JFK when he avoided war in Cuba at the Bay of Pigs and a potential world war during the Cuban Missile Crisis?

What would that have done to our politics from then up today?

Johnson said he didn't reveal it because he didn't want to crush people's view of our democracy, but maybe that pain would have been more than rewarded with pain we avoided later by having a more critical view of our politicians and what they promise.

Let's say that rather than being ridiculed, Goddard's work attracts serious attention from politicians, scientists, and engineers.  The president takes a personal interest in rocketry, or orders it as part of a public works project during the late Depression.   The German Reich, seeing it as another plank to propagandize on, takes a serious and enduring interest in rocketry very early on, rather than in 1940.

1869: The US accepts Buenaventura Baez offer to annex the Dominican Republic.

In the TV show Jericho the cities of Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, St George, Denver, Dallas, Houston, Lawrence, Minneapolis, Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Norfolk, Charlotte, Atlanta, Miami, Hartford, and Boston were nuked with 20 megaton bombs, 23 cities in all. New York and Columbus were other targets, but were stopped before the attack.

In the show the US quickly fractures into California, the Allied States of America (ASA), Texas, Cascadia, CSA, and USA (the northeast) (4/6 names unknown, just taken after popular secession movements in the areas). California and Cascadia (for some reason) join the ASA with the capital of Cheyenne, and the ASA is a corporate-controlled dictatorship (or it's implied to becoming one). The CSA joins the USA, which controls all land east of the Mississippi. Texas stays independent, and the Mississippi river is under UN peacekeeper occupation. For some reason the ASA is becoming more powerful than the USA, despite all the allies and re-callable troops in foreign nations. The fate of Alaska and Hawaii are unknown. Iran and North Korea were also nuked to oblivion by the ASA, to try to hide the fact that it's their fault.

However, let's throw out everything about the nations from Jericho, and instead focus on the what-if case of the 23 nukes in those specific cities. What would result out of that, besides the obvious tens of millions of deaths?

War breaks out with France in 1870 but the German states are led by Austria instead of Prussia.

33,[Suggestion] Permanently Stickied Threads / Topics of the (Day/Subreddit),"**The Problem**

Alright, I'll start off in saying that HistoricalWhatIf is one of my favorite subreddits.  I enjoy learning new things or postulating on how things could have been, and I do dearly love the debates these topics bring.  But at the same time, we also get constantly reiterated topics.  For example, Vikings. 


[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/10gvx1/what_if_vikings_had_set_up_permanent_settlements/) are [eight](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/n2c1w/what_if_the_vikings_had_immunized_the_americans/) separate [occasions](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/v6aaq/what_if_the_vikings_had_managed_to_hold_their/) where we [talk](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/x93xm/what_if_the_vikings_had_colonized_canada_in_the/) about the [Vikings](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/zof29/what_if_leif_ericson_was_able_to_establish_a/) coming to [America](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/wmoc3/what_if_the_vikings_had_continued_to_colonize_the/) and [settling](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/iebs7/what_if_the_vikings_settled_america_first/) down in [Canada](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/10gvx1/what_if_vikings_had_set_up_permanent_settlements/).  I'm not a historical hipster, I have as much respect for the vikings as anyone else, but I don't see the necessity for eight topics starting from scratch.

This topic, too, has interested me, and I'm the top comment on the first link.  But do we need to discuss this six times over?  Or [six](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/ti07n/how_would_ww_ii_end_if_the_empire_of_japan/) topics [about](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/tk3le/what_if_the_japanese_went_north_and_attacked_the/) Japan [fighting](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/zamyf/what_if_japan_hadnt_joined_the_axis_and_had_just/) a [war](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/yzp7x/what_if_the_ussr_became_fully_entrenched_in_a_war/) with [the](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/yzp7x/what_if_the_ussr_became_fully_entrenched_in_a_war/) USSR in [World](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/n71e8/what_if_japan_had_invaded_russia_during_wwii/) War [II](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/u0fs6/what_if_germany_and_japan_had_launched_a_joint/)?


[this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/uef0o/historicalwhatif_we_need_to_talk/) topic also points out multiple threads (more of which have shown up since) about what would happen if the Native Americans were immune to the early diseases.

**Suggestion: Stickied Popular Topics**

While I don't blame anyone for starting these topics or asking them, I would like to suggest that we sticky or at least have particular day topics for broad or exceedingly popular topics like /r/AskHistorian's daily focuses?  Like we could have a day on Vikings, or a day on the Pacific Theatre, or just a thread just devoted to World War II or Hitler.  That way we can really put together everyone's heads all in one place instead of having everyone everywhere at once discussing the same thing.  That way we can have more agreeing/dissenting points of view and less multiple repeats of topics that average two responses.  There are many other, very interesting topics that could also be highlighted more if we didn't repeatedly bury it in reiterations of the same topic.

Imagine a world in which, for one reason or the other, there were no christian missionaries in Japan, or they were completely unsuccessful.

Would the lack of christianity suffice to prevent the isolation of Japan, and if so, how would Japan act? Would it remain politically stable and unified? A shogunate? An empire?

If you choose Army, some examples: Patton gets to play with M26 Pershing tanks in the summer of 1944; Chaffee scout tanks get to Italy in November 1943

32,Von Schleicher's Germany,"Though I'm sure this has probably been done here before, I'd like to have a go at it:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Schleicher

What if von Schleicher was able to create a right wing coalition to rule Germany that doesn't include the Nazis, because Hitler never existed?

Schleicher was deeply involved in merging the military and government before his political career and in fact it seems as though his political career was the next step in creating a military dictatorship in Germany with him at the helm seeking revision of the Versailles treaty.  The militant right wing was supposed to be his pawn to achieve his goal, but historically Hitler preempted him and had Schleicher assassinated in 1934. 

Historically Schleicher was not a fan of the Nazis, but saw them as useful against the left.  Of course the Nazis were not the only militant right wing party at the time who were either working with the Nazis are for themselves.  There is most certainly a less influential Nazi party analogue even without Hitler.

&gt;In late 1926-early 1927, Schleicher told Hindenburg that if it was impossible to form a government headed by the German National People’s Party alone, then Hindenburg should ""appoint a government in which he had confidence, without consulting the parties or paying attention to their wishes"" and with ""the order for dissolution ready to hand, give the government every constitutional opportunity to a majority in Parliament"".[18] 

&gt;This was the origin of the ""presidential governments"". Together with Major Oskar von Hindenburg, Otto Meißner, and General Wilhelm Groener, Schleicher was a leading member of the Kamarilla that surrounded President von Hindenburg. It was Schleicher who came up with the idea of a presidential government based on the so-called ""25/48/53 formula"". Under a presidential government, the head of government (in this case, the chancellor), is responsible to the head of state (president), and not to a legislative body. 

&gt;The ""25/48/53 formula"" referred to the three articles of the Constitution that could make a presidential government possible:

&gt;-Article 25 allowed the President to dissolve the Reichstag.

&gt;-Article 48 allowed the President to sign into law emergency bills without the consent of the Reichstag. However, the Reichstag could cancel any law passed by Article 48 by a simple majority within 60 days of its passage.

&gt;-Article 53 allowed the President to appoint the Chancellor.

&gt;Schleicher′s idea was to have Hindenburg use his powers under Article 53 to appoint a man of Schleicher′s choosing as chancellor, who would rule under the provisions of Article 48. Should the Reichstag threaten to annul any laws so passed, Hindenburg could counter with the threat of dissolution. 

&gt;Hindenburg was unenthusiastic about these plans, but was pressured into going along with them by his son along with Meißner, Groener and Schleicher. During the course of the winter of 1929-30, Schleicher, through various intrigues, undermined the ""Grand Coalition"" government of Hermann Müller with the support of Groener and Hindenburg.[23] In March 1930, Müller′s government fell and the first presidential government headed by Heinrich Brüning came into office.[24]",HistoricalWhatIf,1347991355,wiking85,2,7,True,2012-09-18

His Hellenistic empire never spreads to Asia and the Pacific Rim, and the empire he did build is divided into four parts which eventually disintegrate.

12,What if you became Hitler?,"[The aliens that gave you a time machine](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/z3r47/you_have_a_limited_time_machine_and_are_ordered/) have seen the results of your plan, and have decided to give you a new task. Your new task is to be Hitler, and basically do whatever you want to the world during the 20th century as long as you, Adolf Hitler, has the power to do it.

This time, the aliens give you a better time machine, a TimeTron 9000©, with new features, including SoulSwitcher™, with gives you the ability to become any person you want in the past, but for now, you're going to be Adolf Hitler.

Also, the aliens have given you two scenarios to start with:

**SCENARIO 1**
It's September 6, 1934 (64 years before my cake day!), and it's been around a month since the merger of the offices of Chancellor and President. Yesterday, the advent of a ""Thousand Year Reich"" was proclaimed. Your objective is to lead Germany with your new power. Be Hitler, but do it your way.

Alternatively, if you're more of the World War II guy, and have decided to skip the last years of the Interbellum, and start here:

**SCENARIO 2**
It's March 15, 1939, and Germany took over Czechoslovakia. Europe is ripe for war. Unless you want to stop taking more territories (or find more peaceful ways to occupy Danzig) it's high time Germany starts World War II. But this time, it's different. You can say where and when to invade. You can place more troops here, less troops there. Take Russia, or take Britain. Why not both? Heck, why not conquer the world? If you can, of course.

Also note that you're going to be Adolf Hitler, not who you are now. Don't introduce new technology, or cheat by knowing D-Day before it happens. Good luck.

32,What if John Marshall had never become Chief Justice of the United States?,"Under previous Chief Justice, such as [John Jay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay#The_Jay_Court), the Supreme Court acted as much more a circuit court.  This was before the Congress empowered the creation of other levels of federal courts.

Marshall came in before tradition had hardened and introduced two important elements to his court:

- Unanimity (and collective decision-making during the crucial early precedents)

- Judicial review (through the unanimous [*Marbury v. Madison*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison)

Without Marshall, the Judiciary might have remained fractious and small, with little power to challenge decisions by coequal branches.  Perhaps it would have happened anyway, but Marshall's power as a consensus-builder went a long way toward cementing his persuasive authority -- another messenger might not have done as well.

This means that petitioning the government for the redress of grievances might begin and end at writing letters to Congress or voting in an election.  Tough decisions like *Brown v. the Board of Education* or *Griswold v Connecticut* might have to wait for a drawn-out national consensus, while exacerbating trials like that of *Dred Scott* or the *Amistad* might not have hastened internal strife while the other branches of government sought to strike a compromise.

I suppose this question is another way of asking if the role of a strong and independent judiciary has acted as a pressure valve these past 210 years, or if the lack of judicial review might have resulted in more disparate interpretations of statutes by different judges and less weight given to precedent.

Would the lack of a mechanism we have come to rely on for checking the authority of other branches of government empower the other branches or weaken the entire system?  Both? To what end?",HistoricalWhatIf,1347312347,EdwardJamesAlmost,1,8,True,2012-09-10

Being the closest point of France to the British coast, a few Allied planners sought to land at the Pas de Calais in order to improve the logistical nightmare of opening up a second front.

9,What if the Babenberg dynasty survived?,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II,_Duke_of_Austria

Frederick II Duke of Austria, also known as the quarrelsome because of his series of wars to expand his domain, historically died in a war with Hungary over its Western provinces and his death marked the end of the Babenberg dynasty, the occupation of Austria by the Premyslids, the conquering of the area by the Habsburgs, which marked their rise as the preeminent dynasty in European history.  

What if Frederick II defeated the Hungarians and expanded the Austrian border East?  Already in his 30's and having divorced a wife for not producing children, he would eventually marry and probably produce an heir at some point, allowing the dynasty to continue.  Obviously from here we can suppose many things, but the constant would be the rise of Rudolf Habsburg as the Hohenstaufen replacement as Emperor.  The Babenbergs were staunch supporters of the Hohenstaufens and the Habsburgs were the picked candidate of the Hohenstaufen supporter faction in the Holy Roman Empire, so we can safely assume that Frederick and the Babenbergs would support Rudolf and the resulting Habsburg dynasty for some time.

Frederick seems to have had good relations with the Bavarians and Italian nobles, so won't have to worry about attacks from that direction, but he fought the Czechs and Hungarians quite a bit and they both wanted Austria for their Kingdoms, so the future of the Babenbergs is war with both of those Kingdoms.  Rudolf would be a supporter of Frederick and an enemy of Ottokar of Bohemia for resisting his Emperorship, so I think at some point the Czechs will end up fighting the HRE and losing, like in OTL.  Frederick might get some goodies from that war, but I think the Habsburgs might end up seizing Bohemia for themselves, as they needed a stronger base of power than their meager holdings in Swabia.  

Frederick also tried very hard to raise his holdings in Austria to a Kingdom, which he nearly did under the last Hohenstaufen Emperor, but his teenage niece, who was supposed to marry the 50+ year old man, refused the marriage, which stymied Frederick's plans.  I think under Rudolf Frederick might be able to get Austria named a Kingdom, especially if he fights Ottokar with Rudolf.  In that case then Austria becomes a political heavy in the Holy Roman Empire and the Babenbergs can start making claims on smaller entities near them, like Salzburg, Tyrol, and Carinthia.  

What does everyone else think is going to happen if the Habsburgs don't get Austria and the Babenbergs surviving and taking on a similar regional, though not political role of the historical Habsburgs?",HistoricalWhatIf,1346612352,wiking85,0,7,True,2012-09-02

11,What if Nazi Strategic Bombers Worked?,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_He_177
&gt;**Bombs: Up to 6,000 kg (13,227 lb) of ordnance internally/7,200 kg (15,873 lb) externally or up to 3 Fritz X or Henschel Hs 293 PGMs (w/FuG 203 Kehl MCLOS transmitter installed)**

Historically Germany built 1,200 four engine strategic bombers during WW2 that were better than the B17 bomber, though not as good as the B29...had they worked.  They had massive problems with their engines because they were using two welded together engines to run a single massive propellor on each wing.  Why?  Because the head of the Luftwaffe technical department though that a heavy bomber should be able to launch a dive bombing attack like a Stuka.  The redesigns and increases in weight, plus the use of the two giant propellors (which improved aerodynamics for a dive attack) turned a decent design into a death trap that more often than not caught fire and killed the crew, earning it the nickname 'the Luftwaffe's lighter'.  

So what if instead of requiring this aircraft to be able to dive bomb the Luftwaffe stuck with a four propellor design that would be used for level bombing?  Germany had pretty good bomb sights, even managing to steal the Norden bombsight from the US in 1940, giving them an improved version by January 1941. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotfernrohr_7

As it was the prototype was supposed to enter testing in its original form in September 1938, which, given the usual two year development from first prototype to production, meant that by late Autumn/early Winter 1940 the first units would be ready for production.  Given German inexperience with strategic, four engine bombers, the first squadron of 90-120 aircraft would not be ready until at least June 1941 if not later and probably a smaller unit for Naval Operations in the Atlantic could have been ready in the same time frame, replace the FW200 Condor.

This is too late for the Battle of Britain or the Blitz, but it could be of use for the Battle of the Atlantic and/or Barbarossa.  Though not likely to make too much of a difference in the Atlantic, in Russia it would have a major impact.  Germany historically lacked a strategic bomber during the fighting in the East, so it prevented the Luftwaffe from fighting a strategic bombing campaign against Soviet production.
The Soviets were uniquely vulnerable to a strategic campaign because of their lack industrialization under Stalin.  Instead of having a bunch of smaller power stations for their industry and cities, they had a few mega-stations designed to power the mega-factories that Russia had quickly built under Stalin.  The German during the war identified 11 stations that they could bomb to knock out 75% of power to the Moscow-Upper Volga region, which contained over 70% of Soviet aero-engine production, over 50% of her electronics industry, over 50% of her optics, and a sizable chunk of her tank production.  Also tens of millions of people lived in this area and would lose power for their homes, power for the water pumping stations for sanitation and drinking war, not to mention power for various other critical functions of daily life (like refrigeration).  Also the German identified that these vulnerable stations lack air defense for these stations and had excellent information about them, because German companies had produced the equipment for them, as the Soviet Union lacked the domestic production capacity for this sort of equipment.  Thus there destruction would mean the power stations would be offline for at least 1 year until the US could make the equipment and ship it to the Soviets.  

Source:
http://www.amazon.com/The-German-Air-War-Russia/dp/1877853135

Not only that, but Soviet transportation between the north and south of the country was chock-pointed at three rail bridges in the center of the country that were vulnerable to bombing; their destruction would sever logistics between Moscow and Stalingrad/the Caucasus until they were rebuilt.

Beyond that there was also Soviet Oil production.  85% of it was concentrated in the Caucasus mountains at Maykop, Grozny, and Baku.  Baku alone produced 70% of ALL Soviet oil.  It was also very much unprotected by air defenses.  
http://www.joelhayward.org/Too-Little-Too-Late.2.pdf
It could have been reached from pre-war Soviet airbases in Mariupol that could handle the large bombers and was about 750 miles to Baku, which meant the Heinkel 177 could carry 4 tons of bombs internally to Baku and make it back.    
In comparison when the US bombed the Romanian oil facilities in 1943 from Libya, they could only care 1 ton of bombs to target with 177 bombers.  
The loss of oil would have deprived the mechanized Soviet agriculture industry of their tractors, which enabled them to free up millions of men and animals for the war effort.  Even historically the Soviets were suffering from famine as the result of the loss of Ukraine in 1941.  The loss of more oil would be crippling to Soviet agriculture and Soviet motorized fighting units.

The Ural Mountain factories were also about 1170 miles from the Smolensk airbase, which the Germans had captured and was a class 1 airbase capable of handling large numbers of large bombers.  The Heinkel 177 could carry 2 tons of bombs 3000 miles.  That was the same amount US B17s carried against German factories in 1944.
Also the Soviets lacked domestic radar production historically until 1944.  In 1942-3 the Germans were not able to be detected by Soviet air defenses.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eisenhammer
There was also Operation Eisenhammer planned, which would have attacked the source of Soviet electricity for the Ural factories, which were the primary source of Soviet weapons production.  The plan to float a bomb into the underwater turbines of the huge hydro-electric dam would have shut down 90% of production in the Urals and the huge turbines would not have been repairable for at least a year.

So what does the community think?  Could the Heinkel 177 with its massive bomb capacity and range have made a different to WW2?

Historian of spaceflight David Mindell says [here](http://web.mit.edu/mindell/www/peenemunde.htm), that if Himmler hadn't been blocking von Braun, if the photo had been taken seconds before or after,

    if there’d been a full frontal photo of Von Braun in an SS uniform, the American space program might have turned out rather different.

What do you think? How would a ""full-frontal"" photo of von Braun in his Nazi SS uniform have changed his ability to participate in Operation Paperclip, or his ability to be such a public advocate for space science and exploration once in the United States (being on TV, and the cover of Time magazine, his relationship with Walt Disney).

I think he would have still been able to participate in Paperclip (he was already considered to be of extremely high-value to the Americans), but that wouldn't have been able to be the early face of the space program in the media. It is interesting to wonder who have been the ""space champion"" in his place (if anyone) and how that might have changed the history of spaceflight.

Also the German identified that these vulnerable stations lack air defense for these stations and had excellent information about them, because German companies had produced the equipment for them, as the Soviet Union lacked the domestic production capacity for this sort of equipment. Thus there destruction would mean the power stations would be offline for at least 1 year until the US could make the equipment and ship it to the Soviets.

Not only that, but Soviet transportation between the north and south of the country was chock-pointed at three rail bridges in the center of the country that were vulnerable to bombing; their destruction would sever logistics between Moscow and Stalingrad/the Caucasus until they were rebuilt.

Beyond that there was also Soviet Oil production. 85% of it was concentrated in the Caucasus mountains at Maykop, Grozny, and Baku. Baku alone produced 70% of ALL Soviet oil. It was also very much unprotected by air defenses.

http://www.joelhayward.org/Too-Little-Too-Late.2.pdf 

It could have been reached from pre-war Soviet airbases in Mariupol that could handle the large bombers and was about 750 miles to Baku, which meant the Heinkel 177 could carry 4 tons of bombs internally to Baku and make it back.

In comparison when the US bombed the Romanian oil facilities in 1943 from Libya, they could only care 1 ton of bombs to target with 177 bombers.

The loss of oil would have deprived the mechanized Soviet agriculture industry of their tractors, which enabled them to free up millions of men and animals for the war effort. Even historically the Soviets were suffering from famine as the result of the loss of Ukraine in 1941. The loss of more oil would be crippling to Soviet agriculture and Soviet motorized fighting units.

The Ural Mountain factories were also about 1170 miles from the Smolensk airbase, which the Germans had captured and was a class 1 airbase capable of handling large numbers of large bombers. The Heinkel 177 could carry 2 tons of bombs 3000 miles. That was the same amount US B17s carried against German factories in 1944. Also the Soviets lacked domestic radar production historically until 1944. In 1942-3 the Germans were not able to be detected by Soviet air defenses.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eisenhammer 
There was also Operation Eisenhammer planned, which would have attacked the source of Soviet electricity for the Ural factories, which were the primary source of Soviet weapons production. The plan to float a bomb into the underwater turbines of the huge hydro-electric dam would have shut down 90% of production in the Urals and the huge turbines would not have been repairable for at least a year.

So what does the community think? Could the Heinkel 177 with its massive bomb capacity and range have made a different to WW2?",HistoricalWhatIf,1346763973,wiking85,0,0,True,2012-09-04

51,What if Winston Churchill had not confiscated Turkish battleships in 1914?,"http://www.canakkale.gen.tr/eng/closer/closer5.html

August 2nd, 1914: 10 Downing Street

""Now what is this new idea you had, Mr. Churchill?"". David Lloyd George, Prime Minister of England, was bracing himself. As the British Empire mobilized for war with the Central Alliance, he understood, this would be the first of many ad hoc meetings with his cabinet. As Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill was the most important of all the ministers.

""I have discussed with matter with Admiral Fisher, and we agree that we can bring in the Ottomans on our side. But it will require finesse, and the price of Turkey as our ally will involve a dear expense to the Exchequer."" 

""Do go on. What sort of expense do we mean?""

""Roughly the cost of four or five battleships. But consider the advantages: an open line of supply to Russia in the south, and the Turks have the armies to make this a three theater war.""

""I though you were readying to confiscate the Turkish battleships. Isn't there just two of them?""

""Yes, I was preparing to add the Sultan Osman and the Reshadieh to the fleet, but I noticed something. The Sublime Port had paid for it by public subscription. And that gave me an idea: why don't we make the completion of the sale of those battleships contingent upon a Turkish declaration of war? They have every reason to want to fight against Austria- they've been enemies for centuries. 

The Turks wanted to order two additional battleships, but they lacked the funds. So we offer to give them the two already built, we refund the monies used to purchase those two, and we give them those other two battleships, gratis, on the condition that they reject the center alliance and join our side.

To a degree, we hold their navy hostage until they make a commitment. But we offer them a tempting reward- and the current triumvirate is two cash-strapped after the 1912 war. In the long term, it means being an accomplice to a Turkish resurgence. But we should focus upon the enemies of the moment. Furthermore, it means we can squeeze out the German oil companies in Mesoptamia- our fellows in Persia petroleum can pick up the Iraqi concessions on the cheap. We can make this to the advantage of Britain both in the short run, and the long.

""Your head will be on pulling off this new Crimean alliance. Still, this is the kind of unorthodox thinking that I like to see from you.""

""I think we can bring them in by the 1915 offensives at latest. I have to say, it's better than my original idea for tackling the matter- sending the Australian brigades to seize the Dardanelles.""

Uncharacteristically, Churchill refused another glass of port, to return to his offices. There was much that His Majesty's Ministers had to do upon a balmy August night.",HistoricalWhatIf,1346895795,LeRoienJaune,0,2,True,2012-09-05

How would the catholic/protestant conflicts have been resolved differently? What would have happened to the non-German parts of Austria/Hungary? How would the European powers (France, Britain, Russia, Spain, etc.) react? How would a victorious Austria treat Prussia? Would Prussia be part of Germany? What role would they play if they weren't?

And even then at the end, when according to the documentary there would be an atomic war between the U.S. and Germany, who would be the winner in such a case?",HistoricalWhatIf,1345064059,antgly,0,2,True,2012-08-15

I imagine a Pacific War in which every contested island would have been a total bloodbath (even more so than in OTL).  Battles would have put each sides warriors' to the absolute limits in terms of military honor and sacrifice.  I figure that even to the point that if one side ran out of ammunition, their honor might have even dictated that they fight with melee weapons in order to keep things honorable.  Each side would have shown absolutely no mercy to POWs, felt that their respective emperors were divine, and felt that the warrior is one of the most noble of societal pursuits.  Each side would have idolized their heroes to the point of celebrity, the battles to the point of legend, and their victory a matter of national duty and pride.

While this story is probably spurious, Heraclius did show a general desire to quell religious divisions—even creating his own heresy (Monotheletism) while attempting to reconcile the Monophysites and Nestorians. And the Muslims initially had a neutral attitude toward the Byzantines, while being inflexibly hostile to the Persians.

It doesn’t seem impossible that the Byzantines might have chosen to view Islam as a Jewish/Christian sect, along the lines of the Ebionites. Later Christians were prepared to form an alliance with the (mythical) Nestorian Christian Prester John, and with the partly-Nestorian Mongols. And Heraclius had much the same need for foreign allies, having just repelled a near-conquest of his empire by Persia.

So what if the Byzantines and the first Muslims had recognized each other as co-religionists in some sense, and united against the Persians? Would the Muslims have come to consider themselves Christians, if other Christians accepted them as such? Would they still have attacked the Byzantines eventually—or could the Byzantines have held out if they’d had a few more years to recover from the Persian wars?

From the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison):

""The inaugural address was a detailed statement of the Whig agenda, essentially a repudiation of Jackson and Van Buren's policies. Harrison promised to reestablish the Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency (Henry Clay's American System); to defer to the judgment of Congress on legislative matters, with sparing use of his veto power; and to reverse Jackson's spoils system of executive patronage. He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government.

…

Harrison's death was a disappointment to Whigs, who hoped to pass a revenue tariff and enact measures to support Henry Clay's American System. John Tyler, Harrison's successor and a former Democrat, abandoned the Whig agenda, effectively cutting himself off from the party.""

7,What if Vlad III Tepes had succeeded in assassinating Mehmed II during the Night Attack?,"For those who don't know:

&gt;The Night Attack of Târgovişte (Romanian: Atacul de noapte de la Târgovişte) was a skirmish fought between forces of Vlad III the Impaler of Wallachia and Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire on Thursday, June 17, 1462. The conflict initially started with Vlad's refusal to pay the jizya (tax on non-Muslims) to the Sultan and intensified when Vlad Ţepeş invaded Bulgaria and impaled over 23,000 Turks and Bulgarians. Mehmed then raised a great army with the objective to conquer Wallachia and annex it to his empire. The two leaders fought a series of skirmishes, the most notable one being the Night Attack where Vlad Ţepeş attacked the Turkish camp in the night in an attempt to kill Mehmed. The assassination attempt failed and Mehmed marched to the Wallachian capital of Târgovişte, where he discovered another 20,000 impaled Turks and Bulgarians. Demoralised, the Sultan and his troops retreated.

Over the long term, I think that perhaps another Interregnum/Civil War similar to what happened after the capture and death of Bayezid I by Timur would have occurred, and on an even worse scale that would have seriously threatened the Empire's existence. Mehmed II was a national hero—the Conqueror of Constantinople—after all. To lose him would have been devastating.

4,Crusader Kings II. I think you guys will like this game,"Not sure if this post is really allowed here, but I got this game a couple months back and I'm fairly certain you folks will be interested.

The game is a grand strategy - a map of Europe and the Middle East in which you play as historical characters (note: you don't, as in many strategy games of this nature, play as 'the spirit of a nation' or organisation. You play as a guy, and when he dies, you play as his/her heir). There's no campaign or missions or anything so it's pretty much a sandbox.

The interesting thing is that it's essentially a game of historical what-ifs. From the moment you start playing, which is always a historically accurate start, an alternate history begins to diverge. For instance, I started a game in 1066 playing as King Philip I of France, just before the Norman invasion of England. I decided I didn't fancy the idea of one of my Dukes attempting to wrest control of the crown of England, so I immediately had William the Bastard (as he was then known) assassinated. His death created dissent and chaos amongst Norman vassals and pretty much stopped the invasion. However, this allowed King Harald of Norway's invasion of England to continue for some time, and eventually for a sort of Norwegian Empire to be born.

16,What if Napoleon III did not declare war on Prussia?,"Emperor Napoleon III's declaration of war on Prussia as a result of Chancellor Bismark's deceptive maneuvering caused the downfall of the Second French Empire and the rise of the German Empire in a humiliating war for France that led to their own capital being besieged for a month, after many humiliating defeats. The direct annexation of Alsace and parts of Lorraine in the resulting peace treaty led to a heightening of the bitter Franco-German conflict which would then erupt fully WWI. The Franco-Prussian War also led to almost a century of political instability for France after the relatively stable rule of Napoleon III.

My question to you all is, what would the results be if Napoleon III did not fall for Bismark's bait, and kept France neutral? Let's say he had one of his superstitious bouts of sickness, like the one that prevented him from intervening in the Austro-Prussian War, and that causes him to hold off on war.

* It was envisaged that Britain would use its air force and navy to resist, although a threat from mass rocket attack was anticipated, with no means of resistance except for strategic bombing.

* The Soviet Union had yet to launch its attack on Japan, and so one assumption in the report was that the Soviet Union would instead ally with Japan if the Western Allies commenced hostilities.

It seems like, at least as a layman, that the south is always lagging behind on matters of social justice. The north has to drag the south along, kicking and screaming, to accept the new view even when it's not ready for it. This was apparent when the south initially seceded after it was afraid it couldn't use slaves, then again with women's rights, and again later still with the abolition of Jim Crow laws. The polarization of ideas still seems to persist to this day even on matters such as abortion, evolution, religion, gay rights, and healthcare reform. 

All this leads me to feel like the south has been a kink in the American machine for quite some time now and the north could and would be running a whole lot more smoothly today without it. Although, it's possible that while the north may be allowed to thrive the south may also be allowed to retard, but that's another issue entirely.

17,"What if there had been no plague, and the only European Settlers to stay were those that merged with the Natives...","Pardon me, I'm fresh off a several hour reading tear through the [Devastatingly Logical Fan Theories](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ubaqq/what_fan_theories_have_blown_your_mind_with_their/) thread. In fact, I only left because one of my Rabbit Holes led me to [this Cracked article](http://www.cracked.com/article_19864_6-ridiculous-lies-you-believe-about-founding-america_p2.html?wa_user1=2&amp;wa_user2=History&amp;wa_user3=article&amp;wa_user4=trending_now) about major and common misconceptions of US History. 

While reading one of their cited sources, I read this, ""Indian Peoples were known to be very inclusive, and adoption and marriage of outsiders was common as it turned strangers into family. The idea only made sense."" - ""The Lost Rocks"", David La Vere

(By this point, if you haven't read at least most of the Cracked article, you're not going to understand what I'm referencing)

So my question, this idea I'd love a bit of crowd-sourcing speculation on, is - What if the plague never happened. What if the natives eventually rose up against and defeated (as they are historically MORE than likely to have done) those settlers who began to aggressively expand or enslave while they simultaneously merged with those settlers who saw/appreciated (like the Roanoke colony) the value of the natives, their society and their obvious superior ability at surviving fruitfully in a strange land. What if instead of a nation ""conquered and restructured, we had merged into an inclusive, highly functional and powerful native society. What would an America that grew out of the merging of those two peoples look like? 

It's a pretty broad question with a rather large potential for possible futures, but I think one thing is for sure; it would look very different than it looks today.

I would really love to hear thoughts, speculations, etc of how you think that culture would have evolved, how that culture would have played into world events that America played into so powerfully, etc. If  I'm really lucky maybe some experts (in history, anthropology and whatever field you need to specialize in to conjecture this type of scenario) will weigh in. Or, I'll spend the next few days silently churning the idea over in my own brain until it gets to big for me to handle.

(I think it would be way more fun with you guys...)

**TL;DR** Read the Cracked article, picture what America would be like if European settlers had merged with a (non-plague decimated) Native culture, what could America's history have looked like instead? How about its present?

However, the book then took a few logical ideas such as the British accidentally attacking a Confederate held island instead of the US held one due to logistical error then wanders off into the realm of the incredibly fanciful in which the British decide that ""well, we might as well try to conquer the entire country"", the CSA and USA are rejoined, and the US sets up Quebec as an independent country. Also, anyone who isn't American is an idiot simpleton who completely believes in Britain's superiority in the face of every crushing defeat.

I've thrown together a quick scenario if this is impossible to answer otherwise. 

The scenario finds itself around 200AD. The Partian, Kushan empires and the small, surrounding states utterly collapsed after years of war, political strife, and various disasters. Due to an extensive diplomatic campaign by Rome and the Han, all existing hostilities ate stopped.

21,What if Germany and Japan had launched a joint invasion of the USSR during World War II?,"Germany and Japan had already signed the Anti-Comintern Pact to prevent the spread of the Soviet Union/ Communism and Japan had a rather long and hostile relationship with the country already.  So, what if instead of attacking Pearl Harbor, the Japanese instead opted to invade the USSR from the east in conjunction with Germany's Operation Barbarossa?  

By not attacking Pearl Harbor, the Japanese likely would have removed the cause for an all-out war with America allowing them to concentrate their forces in Asia.  They would have had access to the tremendous resources of the Russian Far East and space for their burgeoning population to settle.  Meanwhile, Germany would be up against a Soviet Union forced to fight a two-front war and, I think, unable to win.  In the end, I think that Germany would have gotten their Lebensraum (territory up to and including the Ural Mountains) and Japan would have winded up with something very similar in the Russian Far East (everything up to and including Lake Baikal).  Maybe they would have let the USSR keep everything in between.

With international opinion of the Soviets low after the Winter War against Finland, would the western allies perhaps have joined Germany against the Russians, as was Stalin's fear (and, as some speculate, why the Soviets insisted on keeping Hess imprisoned until he was into his 90s?)

As for the Pacific, its fairly certain that Japan would have carried out war with the US regardless... but with all of their focus on Japan, and the (possibly undivided) assistance of the UK, Australia, Canada, etc, would the war turn against Japan even faster, perhaps leading up to the home islands well before the Manhattan Project finished developing the first atomic weapons?

My belief is that had Germany, and to a lesser extent Austria-Hungary, and their allies, won the war, the world today would be a different - but much better - place.  

No carnage of the Western Front, no colossal waste of life.  No ""Lost Generation"".  Perhaps the Spanish influenza would have still occurred, but with greatly reduced effect.  A much quieter Russian Revolution (if there's one at all); no rise of Communism.  No Treaty of Versailles, and no crippling indemnities on Germany; no Nazis.  No Holocaust.  No Cold War.  No Korea, Vietnam, or Afghanistan.  

The only flashpoint I can see would be Japan's militaristic expansion in the '20s/'30s, which might lead to a war with the US/UK/France/Netherlands/Imperial Germany over colonies in Asia and the Pacific, a war which Japan would lose handily.

Continental Europe would likely be dominated by a German-controlled customs and trade union...much like today's EU.  The British Empire would still control much of the globe.

This could have happened in 2 ways:

-He steals the Republican nomination from Taft and cruises to the White House

-His newly formed Bull Moose party decimates Republican opposition and the Socialist Eugene Debs siphons enough votes for him to squeak through


Either way i think this would have happened:

-We might see civil rights movement kick off a few decades earlier

-Compulsory Military Service

-Some sort of Remedial Health Care that is expanded to resemble Canadian Medicare

-USA entering WWI much sooner, and gives the Central Powers a White Peace with borders untouched (mostly), France and the UK are pissed but they can't do anything about it since the USA has a developed and fast growing Military Industrial complex (thanks to the Compulsory Service)

-Establishment of an International Court in lieu of the League of Nations

-Russian Revolution either does not happen or takes place with the White faction winning out over the Reds (Bolsheviks) since again Roosevelt is much more proactive in aiding the Whites. Might even result in a Constitutional Monarchy

-No treaty of Versailles, no reparations, no National Socialists, although we might still see Mussolini

-American foreign policy might end up being much more strict on Japanese aggression in China

-American society today would be more socially conservative (no counter culture, no beatniks to influence us), yet fiscally liberal

However if he wins by the second option we can also see:

-An introduction of another permanent major party into the system

-Emboldened socialists-who now live in a world without the USSR and the red scares caused by it-either merge into the Bull Moose party or become national in their own right, sort of like the Liberal Democrats in the UK.

-As a result the electoral college is modified or chucked out in lieu of popular vote

I'm not saying 'occupation' in a pejorative sense (as it seems is often used as), I mean following the invasion. From what I understand, despite public perception, initial military engagement was fast and effective. In the sense that Iraqi military forces were overcome quickly. What I mean is, once coalition forces (chiefly US and UK) actually had to 'hold ground,' I believe there was some contention that a lot more ground forces were needed to effectively 'maintain order.' Would it have made sense to institute a draft at this point to get more 'boots on the ground' to pacify resistance and help rebuild infrastructure and train Iraqi forces.

While that alone it probably didn't cause big changes in human behavior and characteristics, it is noteworthy how this proves that humans and Neanderthals met and interracted. 

I started thinking - humans wandered out of Africa around 70.000 years ago, which was when they started wearing clothing. Incidentally, it was also when they banged them some Neanderthals. 

Many archaeologists seem to assume that either party raped the other, and that our Neanderthal genes are a result of that, but what if they are wrong? What if our Neanderthal cousins sat down with the humans and taught them how to survive in a climate that was harsher than that in Africa? Introduced them to clothing? Perhaps this was a cultural exchange, not a brutal replacement?

26,If Hitler had a different motive.,"Please not before hand I am not anti-Semitic, a holocaust denier or a Nazi sympathizer. So don't hate me.

I recently took great interest in German history and wrote a paper on German unification, now I am looking at more recent history and my brain started wandering. Everyone is taught that the motive behind the holocaust was the Nazi's continuing the process of (a twisted) natural selection and how Hitler is portrayed as a crazy racist psychopath. But what if this wasn't the case, what if Hitler was a smart guy and the ultimate altruist? Please try to retain some sense of objectivity and I apologize in advance if this offends you in any manner.
It wouldn't take a genius to realize that a quickly advancing world needed to be united instead of divided and the way in which to unite people is to create a common enemy. The Nazi's are portrayed as the penultimate of evil and Germany at the time was arguably the most powerful state in the world. So my question is, what if Hitler started World War II under the guise of reclaiming lost German honor, committed one of the worst genocides in human history in order to vilify his self and party in order to create a common enemy for the rest of the world? I don't see the idea of creating a common enemy to unite the world as a particularly difficult concept to grasp though whether or not this was his intention is going to be extremely controversial (and one sided).
Out of WWII we did get the United Nations, and the world has become globalized and this all snowballed after WWII and more so after the Cold War ended.

So to summarize: what if Hitler did what he did knowingly in order to unite the world?
- war created a common enemy for nations to band together
- holocaust was to vilify him
- started the war using smart moves/strategies but ultimately makes stupid calls which bring Germany's fall (possibly to ensure allied victory?)

So what are people's opinions of this theory and it is just that, a theory. So please don't think I think it is his motive, it's just some speculation. ",HistoricalWhatIf,1334369890,[deleted],0,1,True,2012-04-13

Also, while they relied on us quite a bit for supplies before the end of the war, they also had Eastern European and German manufacturing capacity at this point, albeit at a much lower rate than before we bombed them.

2,What if the Trent Affair lead to war?,"&gt; The Trent Affair, also known as the Mason and Slidell Affair, was an international diplomatic incident that occurred during the American Civil War. On November 8, 1861, the USS San Jacinto, commanded by Union Captain Charles Wilkes, intercepted the British mail packet RMS Trent and removed, as contraband of war, two Confederate diplomats, James Mason and John Slidell. The envoys were bound for Great Britain and France to press the Confederacy’s case for diplomatic recognition by Europe.

&gt; The initial reaction in the United States was to rally against Britain, threatening war; but President Abraham Lincoln and his top advisor's did not want to risk war. In the Confederate States, the hope was that the incident would lead to a permanent rupture in Anglo-American relations and even diplomatic recognition by Britain of the Confederacy. Confederates realized their independence potentially depended on a war between Britain and the U.S. In Britain, the public expressed outrage at this violation of neutral rights and insult to their national honour. The British government demanded an apology and the release of the prisoners while it took steps to strengthen its military forces in Canada and the Atlantic.

&gt; After several weeks of tension and loose talk of war, the crisis was resolved when the Lincoln administration released the envoys and disavowed Captain Wilkes's actions. No formal apology was issued. Mason and Slidell resumed their voyage to Britain but failed in their goal of achieving diplomatic recognition.

A point of departure being perhaps a more belligerent administration on either side. The French Emperor Napoleon had agreed to help supply the Confederate forces and had even started to build them ironclads. The British meanwhile are producing ships such as the [HMS Warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Warrior_%281860%29) which would easily have broken any blockade of southern ports.

17,Some advice would be much appreciated. [x-post from r/askhistorians],"It was suggested that this might get some attention on this thread, so here we go!

I am the president of my high school's Model UN club. We have recently received the list of positions for a Model UN conference. I have had the pleasure of getting on to a Crisis Committee, which is a specialized, small committee where a crisis is presented (or multiple) and must be dealt with over the three-day weekend.

The committee I am on is a triple joint-crisis committee between the Indian War Cabinet, the Pakistani War Cabinet, and the UN Security Council. My specific position is the Pakistani Ambassador to India. The setting of the committee is right after the India-Pakistan War of 1971.

Now, though the specific crises have not yet been released, I appreciate the challenge that my position poses me. I am well aware that this defeat was absolutely crippling for Pakistan, in almost every possible manner. As Ambassador to India, it will be quite challenging negotiating a peace agreement that releases our 90,000 POWs and does not force us to recognize Bangladesh.

I think it's also important to mention that since this is a simulation, things to not necessarily have to go according to how it actually happened in history. (So, I don't necessarily have to sign the Simla Agreement as Pakistan did in reality) Also, the beauty of a crisis committee is that there is leeway for the delegates to arrange for things such as political assassinations, terrorist plots, declarations of war, economic collapses. Essentially, if you can imagine it (and the chair of the committee approves of this new development) you can make it happen.

So, the question I pose. In my difficult position, how can I negotiate with India without ceding too much to them? Or, how could I use Pakistan's allies (China and the US) to offer international pressure on India (essentially, since the two greater nations were unofficial supporters of Pakistan, how could I make it official?)

Any general advice, or useful information, for my position would also be greatly appreciated.

It's not quite a counter-history in the Turtledovian sense, since my time voyagers meet real people and participate in real events from the ""known record.""  But they do alter them slightly...

And as the books continue, history becomes increasingly ""jarred loose,"" with various accounts and memories starting to contradict each other - by book two, Jefferson finds himself reading up on astrolabe experiments done by Hypatia. Etc.

As a child of the 60's, I always wondered what shape the country would be in if even one of those assassinations could have been averted.

6,11/22/63 - Stephen King discussion (spoilers),"If you haven't read it already, I'd recommend reading it. He bases most of his information off of historical fact and countless hours of research. His argument is this (mind you, he discussed the possibilities with legitimate historians):

*Main character is sent back to 1958, to live through history, prove that Oswald was the killer, and then stop Oswald (the title itself suggests this).*

*Kennedy is saved by main character, who then does his best disappearing act.

*Kennedy throws money at Vietnam, does not escalate. He doesn't follow through on Civil Rights (LBJ is squelched). 

*Tet occurs, (67). America is dismantled. 

*MLK still dies, but in Chicago. Race Riots break out (68). 

*Wallace wins election, due to the Democratic shortfall. His Vice President is Curtis Lemay. Gross militarism ensues.

*Wallace nukes Hanoi, as promised.

*Wallace is assassinated, Humphrey wins. (76)

*Iranian hostage crisis occurs, Hump does nothing all 200 die. 

*Etc, etc, etc. World is ruined, environmental dismay. World plotted to end in 2080 due to nuclear blasts/environmental repercussions.

I think it certainly is interesting and far-reaching. But, still he has some valid points. Kennedy might not have had the fortitude many had assumed he had. He may have not wanted to seem as a softy, being he was elected as a hard line cold warrior. So, he throws money at it, but doesn't want to put the kybash on the whole thing. People MLK is assassinated (Hoover gets fed up). Race riots still ensue. The country get's pissed (elects the other party when one party doesn't come through for them) Wallace is very popular due to race riots. Militarism ensues. 

Shit goes down hill, fast. 

I think he makes an interesting point about Kennedy in that he may have been unable to really pass any Civil Rights legislation (he was unfavorable in the south anyways, never mind if he supported desegregation in his first term) and would be unwilling to stop Vietnam, however he wouldn't want to escalate Vietnam either.

During the peace treaty, it was exposed that the Americans did not execute a final planned assault because it was deemed futile in the case of reinforcements, and also because there were insuffient ships to blockade the Saint Lawerence, had they have occupied to the north of the river.

Because of this, the Americans were treated well at the treaty, only losing small tracts of land such as the Northwest Angle and the Upper Peninsula. Tecumesh was also recognised at the treaty as a great ally and he was able to secure a large area of land from Grand Island to around St. Catherines (or maybe even Hamilton).

If Germany had been successful in capturing the three main oil producing regions in the Soviet Union (most importantly Baku) they would have secured an immense supply of oil while taking ninety percent of the Soviet Union's.

How would the Soviet Union react to losing the vast majority of their oil supply? Would the USA begin to make up for some of this with their Lend-Lease program?

Would Germany have been able to hold such a vast new amount of territory or would their lines have been spread so thinly that they would have been subject to a Stalingrad style encirclement in the Caucasus?

5,What if the US had accepted Japan's surrender pre-Pearl Harbor.,"Some would argue that Japan was essentially forced to attack the US. at Pearl harbor. Below is a little back story that many may not be familiar with. War was completely avoidable with Japan, but the US didn't take the route. What I ask is, what would the world be like if we had brokered piece with Japan?

=======Background=======

In 1941, Japan was 4 years into a war in China she couldn't win or end. Inside the government was a powerful faction led by Prime Minister Prince Fumimaro Konoye that desperately did not want a war with the United States. The “pro-Anglo-Saxon” camp included the navy, whose officers had fought alongside the U.S. and Royal navies in World War I, while the war party was centered on the army, Gen. Hideki Tojo and Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, a bitter anti-American. On July 18, 1941, Konoye ousted Matsuoka, replacing him with the “pro-Anglo-Saxon” Adm. Teijiro Toyoda.

The U.S. response: On July 25, we froze all Japanese assets in the United States, ending all exports and imports, and denying Japan the oil upon which the nation and empire depended. Stunned, Konoye still pursued his peace policy by winning secret support from the navy and army to meet FDR on the U.S. side of the Pacific to hear and respond to U.S. demands.

U.S. Ambassador Joseph Grew implored Washington not to ignore Konoye’s offer, that the prince had convinced him an agreement could be reached on Japanese withdrawal from Indochina and South and Central China. Out of fear of Mao’s armies and Stalin’s Russia, Tokyo wanted to hold a buffer in North China.

On Aug. 28, Japan’s ambassador in Washington presented FDR a personal letter from Konoye imploring him to meet. Tokyo begged us to keep Konoye’s offer secret, as the revelation of a Japanese prime minister’s offering to cross the Pacific to talk to an American president could imperil his government. On Sept. 3, the Konoye letter was leaked to the Herald-Tribune.

On Sept. 6, Konoye met again at a three-hour dinner with Grew to tell him Japan now agreed with the four principles the Americans were demanding as the basis for peace. No response. On Sept. 29, Grew sent what Hoover describes as a “prayer” to the president not to let this chance for peace pass by.

On Sept. 30, Grew wrote Washington, “Konoye’s warship is ready waiting to take him to Honolulu, Alaska or anyplace designated by the president.” No response. On Oct. 16, Konoye’s cabinet fell.

In November, the U.S. intercepted two new offers from Tokyo: a Plan A for an end to the China war and occupation of Indochina and, if that were rejected, a Plan B, a modus vivendi where neither side would make any new move. When presented, these, too, were rejected out of hand.

At a Nov. 25 meeting of FDR’s war council, Secretary of War Henry Stimson’s notes speak of the prevailing consensus: “The question was how we should maneuver them (the Japanese) into … firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.”

“We can wipe the Japanese off the map in three months,” wrote Navy Secretary Frank Knox.

===============And now you know, the rest of the story==================

tl;dr Japan offered us peace multiple times if we lifted our embargo, giving up all the empire conquests they had made in the prior 4 years.

3,German 1918 offensives succeed,"What if the Germans plan their 1918 offensives differently, which results in their success?  I laid out the scenario at another What If website:
http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=219817
The Germans grab Amiens and Hazebrouck, which results in the British being forced to withdraw from France to England to regroup.  This causes major political fall out.

In my view this is what happens:
Basically the Germans manage to score enough critical successes to cause the Belgians and French to ask for a separate peace.
The Germans are exhausted, but the French public is in revolt and start to form communes while the army starts to disintegrate Russia-style.  This forces them to submit to an unfavorable peace, which leaves the Americans and British no place to really fight.  Italy jumps ship when France asks for an armistice, saving Austria-Hungary from total collapse.  The fighting ends by July when the French and Belgians ask for an armistice.

Ultimately Germany gets a freehand in the East, annexes Luxembourg, grabs parts of France (front slope of the Vosges and Longwy-Briey), and gets the French and Belgian Congo.  They also get a customs union with Belgium and avoid all reparations.

Meanwhile they lose all of their colonies save for the Congo.  They probably have to submit to a naval treaty that limits the number of ships they can have.

Austria-Hungary gets Serbia, minor border revisions with Italy, and a hand in the future of Poland.  Still, by 1919 the Empire falls into Civil War and dissolves.

The Ottomans lose Iraq up to Bagdad, Jordan, Palestine and the Hejaz, but keeps everything else.

Bulgaria keeps all of its gains.

Greece falls into civil war and their king gets restored while the pro-Entente rebels that dragged the country into the war get purged.

Serbia ceases to exist and ultimately end up a part of a Croatian-dominated Yugoslavia.

Italy falls into civil war and the Socialists end up on top.

France is ruined financially and the Third Republic collapses, with a more conservative 4th Republic replacing it after social and political instability and a period of violence.

Britain is also heavily in debt, but gains German colonies, so can say it 'won' by still having and independent Belgium and gaining vassals in the Middle East.  Labor rises sooner.

Russia still goes communist, but takes longer to get there and its bloodier.  Germany has too many problems to really intervene and Britain lets the Germans deal with it.

Germany also has major political unrest as everyone is fed up with the Kaiser.  Major political reforms are agitated for, which results in a constitution, but the Socialists don't end up with a majority.  Poland and the Baltic become quagmire of military commitments, which the public rapidly tires of.  Ukraine ultimately goes communist once the German public refuses to support the army in its efforts to prop up unpopular regimes in the Caucasus and Ukraine.  

Germany ends up the economic superpower on the continent, which causes Britain and the US to get over their hostility to Germany in the aftermath of the war to have access to the markets they control.  In the wake of the war economic competition and supporting rebels in each others' sphere is commonplace, but tappers off into the 1930's.

5,World after a negotiated peace in 1917,"What if the Germans refrained from resuming unrestricted submarine warfare and the US remains neutral, which results in both sides coming to an agreement in 1917 ending the Great War.  What does the world look like?

Historically the Woodrow Wilson advised the American public not to invest in Entente (British, French, Italian, Russian, etc.) bonds in late 1916, because they no longer had collateral (gold, foreign currency, bonds, etc) to take out loans.  Instead they were trying to raise unsecured loans/bond issuances.  

Without these loans the Entente could not continue to fight the war.  Russia would have to make peace in early 1917 without loans to prevent bankruptcy.  France also no longer could finance the war by April 1917.  The Italians were in a similar boat.  Britain could continue to fight, but would have to cut their production by 40%.  Germany still had the means to continue and could keep her allies fighting until late 1918.

Let's say the catalyst is that Romania does not declare war on Austria.  This resulted in Erich von Falkenhayn losing his position and the rise of the military dictatorship under Hindenburg and Ludendorff.  Falkenhayn was against resuming unrestricted submarine warfare and finally had the support of the Kaiser and the Chancellor Bethman-Hollweg.  Historically Bethman was threatened with losing his job by Ludendorff, so agreed to support the declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare, but lost his job anyway when Ludendorff demanded he resign.  Here both Falkenhayn and Bethmann survive politically despite the huge pressure against them.
By December 1916 the Czar is removed from power and politically Falkenhayn and the increasingly defeatist Bethmann are given a boost.  The Russian revolution then solidifies their position, along with the French failure during the Nivelle offensive.  

France, Russia, and Britain are officially broke in May 1917 without US entry into the war and the flood of money they brought with them.  They and the Central Powers talk terms and ultimately results in a peace deal in late 1917.
The Germans lose their colonies and restore Belgium, but get Luxembourg and no reparations.  They also get Poland and the Baltic area up to Riga.  No Brest-Litovsk or Bolshevik revolution in October.  
Austria gets more defensible borders with Italy and gets full control over Serbia and Montenegro.
Bulgaria gets to keep her gains.
The Ottomans lose Palestine and Basra, but keep everything north of Bagdad, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and their pre-war border with Russia.  

Britain gets an enlarged Kuwait and Palestine, plus splits up Germany's colonies with France and her Dominion nations.  

Italy gets nothing but a civil war. 

France is exhausted and broke and gets political violence, but the government survives.

Russia is smaller and gets lots of violence, but avoid a major civil war and keeps the Czar, but replaces Nicholas with his uncle, who signs a constitution and becomes a constitutional monarch.  

AH fights a short, sharp civil war 6 months after the end of the war, but survives.  The most radical minorities lose their leaders and most radical soldiers to the violence and exile.  The Czech legion can't go home and disperses around the world.  The Empire totters on.

Revolutionary war veterans are hungery and poor as the local middle class begins to squeeze them to pay foreign investors who the vets had just fought from interfering in American politics. The veterans begin to band together to resist being thrown in debtors prison. Tensions escalate after the leader of the movement were indicted for treason under the Riot Act, suspending habeas corpus to execute the rioters as traitors. 

January 1787 Shay lead his militia to seize the arms at the Springfield Armory. Merchants equiped their own forces (ironically many of them being veterans themselves)  out of Boston and sent them to protect the armory. Shay's message to Luke Day to coordinate the attack was lost however and Shay's militia's surprise attacked was unsupported. The merchant -militia seized the weapons there and fired into Shay's forces. Horrified that their fellow veterans would fire on them, Shay's forces fled north. By March, resistance crumbled. 


TLDR; Revolutionary war vets didn't get paid, rioted. Tried to take arms at the Springfield Armory and were fired on by merchant owned militia-men. Rioting continues and spirals out of control with the looting of Stockbridge. 

What if Shay and Day's Regulators had seized the armory before General Shepard had? I'm assuming Washington would pressured the states to raise Federal forces and marched on them. I think the political implications would have been an even stronger Federalist showing at the Constitutional Convention, weakening Anti-Federalist for a very long time.

0,What if the Partition of India in 1947 had never happened?,"As a Pakistani, this question is both controversial and thought provoking.

The way I see it, had the Muslim League (i.e. Jinnah) and Congress (i.e. Nehru) not gone their separate ways at the start of the 1940s over personal and political disagreements, the creation of Pakistan and Bharat would have probably never taken place.

That way the Muslim-majority regions of north-west India and Bengal were amalgamated into West and East Pakistan in 1947 (and further more into Bangladesh in 1971), the Hindu-Muslim-Sikh ethnic cleansing and migrations, and the forced annexation of semi-autonomous 'princely states' to incorporate the new countries would have never happened.

As far as I'm concerned, we would have probably seen a somewhat United India with some glaring differences: 

* The North West Frontier Province (modern day Khyber-Pakhtunkhawa and FATA in Pakistan) had a massively popular secular Pashtun nationalist movement of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan that was pro-Congress and anti-Muslim League, and favoured the dissolution of the Durand Line and a union of NWFP (and Pashtun-dominated northern Balochistan) with Afghanistan to create a Pashtun superstate 'Pakhtunistan'. 

* The demands for Pakhtunistan would have been immediately rejected by the large Hindko-speaking Hazarewal community of NWFP and the districts that make up densely populated Hazara Division would have demanded to remain with United India instead. Bear in mind, it was the Hazarewals who immediately favoured the Muslim League and their votes helped NWFP become part of Pakistan in the mid-1940s, and in modern times strongly protested against the renaming of NWFP as Khyber-Pakhtunkhawa as well as demanding their own Hazara province in retaliation.

* Some of the large [princely states under the British Raj](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_state) like Hyderabad (Deccan), Jammu &amp; Kashmir, and a Baloch tribal confederacy under the Khan of Kalat would have probably still demanded complete independence from this new India. Leading to forced annexations, violence, and perhaps eventual independence of far-flung states like Balochistan to make United India more manageable.

**EDIT**: Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal, and Bhutan would have still seen independence rather than be part of United India.

* The non-existence of Muslim League vs Congress rivalry would have given fuel to the secular Marxist-Socialist Bengali nationalism that would have thrived as a powerful force to created a United Bengal republic that combined both East and West Bengals into either a completely independent country, or an autonomous region with special status within United India. Independent Bengal would have a population of nearly 300 million today!

* United Bengal would cut off India with its North-eastern states of Assam, Manipur, Mizoram etc and their independence would have also been on the table for United India to deal with.

* Tamil, Sindhi, and Punjabi nationalisms would also have been realistic issues to deal for United India with their own demands of extra autonomy, devolution, and what not. United India would essentially be a large secular federal state with a weak central government and greater control of states/provinces to manage their own affairs within the federation.

* United India would retain its Hindu-majority, but the Muslim population of United India would be the largest in the world by combining much of the Muslim populations of modern day Pakistan, India and perhaps Bangladesh without population displacements. United India would have considerable influence on (as well as being influenced by) Muslim states across the world.

* United India would have become a huge challenge for China, USSR, USA, UK and its neighbours to deal with a foreign policy probably not entirely based on Nehru's idealistic 'non-aligned' status. 

* United India would NOT be a perfect state, in fact it would still have to deal with immense poverty, illiteracy, communal and ethnic tensions, Capitalism vs Communism clashes, limited industrialisation etc that could make United India more reliant on foreign aid and investment to improve infrastructure in and outside its urban centres.

So I wonder - in 1938, Germany was a stable nation that was regarded with a wary eye, but not as an active threat. If Hitler had held off, he probably would've been left alone. So what if he had waited ten years to really build up his forces and resources? 

Significant variables:

- Depending on the war in the Pacific, FDR may not have won a third term. In any event, Truman would be President in 1949. 
- Either Japan would already be defeated, or Hitler may have gotten them to hold off so they could engage the US in a two-front war. 
- If the Nazis held off on the Holocaust, the Manhattan Project would've been crippled. 
- The V-2 would've been perfected
- Hitler would've had a solid jet air force
- The Me 264 ""USA Bomber"" may have been operational
- By the late 1940s, an undamaged Europe would probably have been more of an economic force. In fact, if the US felt economically threatened, we may have sit on the sidelines for much longer while two goliaths slugged it out. 
- Stalin's army might have recovered from the Great Purge and been an even more significant force. Alternatively, without a Nazi invasion to bolster him, Stalin may have been deposed. 
- Without Hitler's invasion to embarrass him, Chamberlain probably would've stayed in office longer. Not sure what the effects of this would be.

14,What if the assassination attempt of Julius Caesar had failed?,"Let's say that Caesar's senatorial conspirators failed in their attempt to kill him and their plan was revealed.

Based on what we know of that era's history, it's safe to say that Caesar would have killed off or imprisoned most, if not all, of his enemies on the charge of high treason. This would have possibly inspired a rebellion on the part of the more conservative upper class, though the mercenaries hired would have been put down with ease by the massive Roman army. Caesar would probably grow more paranoid by the day, enacting increasingly despotic laws until his people, including a large portion of the Roman military, turned against him. Depending on the size of this rebellion, his forces would either fall completely or be permanently weakened. If the former, he would have probably been captured and executed by the newly-reformed Senate. Subsequently, the Republic of Rome would have been renewed for some time until it eventually met its end to infighting among politicians/military leaders due to conservative inefficiency.

With the premature demise of Rome (and therefore its inability to flower during the Pax Romana) there would be little to no unity among the peoples of Western Europe. Britain wouldn't have been conquered in the first century CE, Spain wouldn't have flourished as a result of Latin influences, Christianity (and therefore Islam, among other religions) would have never been founded, the Byzantines would have never come to represent a post-Alexandrian blending of east and west, the Kievan Rus wouldn't have eventually become a bastion of Greco-Roman preservation, and practically everything that we know about the world since the founding of the Roman Empire would have been changed.

While another power, most likely a Germanic or Mediterranean nation, would have eventually taken Rome's place, there's no saying as to just how it would impact the millennia of civilization that followed its coming to power.

In addition, forcing Stalin to commit forces to both sides of a two-front war would have made it more difficult for the Soviets to resist German forces.

Without significant Soviet assistance, the Chinese communists wouldn't have had much chance against the Nationalists, who would have probably been able to retain southern China, even if they weren't strong enough to reconquer the northern Manchukuo puppet state still controlled by the Japanese.

So imagine an Asia where the eastern half of Russia is Japanese, China split into a southern Nationalist state and the Manchukuo north, the US controls the Pacific, with a rump Soviet state in the Urals and Caucasus.",HistoricalWhatIf,1305958418,takatori,12,24,True,2011-05-21
